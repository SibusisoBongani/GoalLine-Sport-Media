      Mamelodi Sundowns’ Lucas Ribeiro Costa was officially crowned Footballer of the Season for the 2024/25 Betway Premiership at the PSL Awards ceremony held today.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
At the end of the league campaign, he led the standings with 16 goals, securing the top scorer title in the Betway Premiership.<br>
Ribeiro Costa’s stellar run during the season was highlighted by multiple monthly honours:<br><br>
Player of the Month for September/October 2024, February 2025, and May 2025
Goal of the Month recipient for January, February, and May 2025<br><br>
This tally reflects his exceptional consistency in scoring and playmaking across key periods of the season.<br>
During February 2025, Ribeiro Costa was directly involved in eight goal contributions across seven Betway Premiership matches—scoring five times and assisting three—and netted a solo goal against Orlando Pirates that earned Goal of the Month recognition.

    <h2>Yusuf Maart Completes European Move from Kaizer Chiefs to SV Ried</h2>
    <h6 class="dateandauthor">By Azola Ngxanga | 15 July 2025</span></h6>
    <img src="images/Yusuf Maart.jpg" alt="Image of Yusuf Maart">

    <p>
      Yusuf Maart has officially completed a transfer from Kaizer Chiefs to Austrian Bundesliga club SV Ried, marking a significant step in the midfielder’s career as he moves abroad for the first time at the age of 29.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The deal was confirmed earlier this week after weeks of speculation, with the South African international set to join Ried ahead of the 2025–26 Austrian season.

The move brings an end to Maart’s three-year spell at Kaizer Chiefs, where he served as club captain and became a fan favourite through his leadership and consistent performances in midfield. Chiefs reportedly exercised a one-year extension clause in his contract in June but ultimately agreed to release him for a transfer fee of approximately €1 million. While Transfermarkt also lists Maart’s market value at €1 million, multiple reports confirm that SV Ried reached an agreement to secure the player on a permanent deal.<br><br>
Maart made 95 appearances in all competitions for Amakhosi, scoring seven goals and assisting eight. His most iconic moment came in May 2025 when he scored the winning goal in the Nedbank Cup final, ending the club’s ten-year trophy drought. His farewell message to the club and supporters was emotional, as he thanked teammates, coaches, and fans for standing by him through highs and lows. He described Kaizer Chiefs as a place that will “always be home.”<br><br>
Now entering a new phase of his career, Maart arrives at SV Ried as the club prepares for its return to the Austrian top flight. In his unveiling, the midfielder said he was excited by the challenge of playing in Europe and grateful for the opportunity. He acknowledged the physical nature of Austrian football and committed to adapting quickly to make a strong impact. SV Ried’s management praised Maart’s technical ability, international experience, and leadership qualities.<br><br>
Kaizer Chiefs, meanwhile, have already named Angolan international Miguel Inacio as the club’s new captain. The club is expected to reinforce its midfield during the transfer window as it prepares for both domestic competition and its upcoming CAF Confederation Cup campaign.<br><br>

      Banyana Banyana are back in action tonight as they face Tanzania in a pivotal Group C match at the 2025 CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Oujda, Morocco.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The match kicks off at 21:00 South African time at the Honneur Stadium, with South Africa looking to make it two wins from two and edge closer to a place in the quarterfinals.<br><br>
        Linda Motlhalo scored from the penalty spot and Jermaine Seoposenwe added a second in South Africa's opening 2–0 win over Ghana. Speaking ahead of the Tanzania clash, coach Desiree Ellis said: "Yes, we have played Tanzania before, but that goes out of the window — it means nothing. We must make sure we don't concede. We are going to create opportunities, and we need to take those opportunities and be more effective in the attacking third."<br><br>
        Tanzania are coming off a narrow defeat to Mali and are under pressure to get a result. South Africa, meanwhile, know a second win would put them in control of the group with one game remaining.

      Orlando Pirates have confirmed that winger Monnapule Saleng will spend the 2025/26 season on loan at newly-promoted DStv Premiership side Orbit College.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">

        Orbit College, preparing for their debut season in the Premiership, are hoping Saleng's experience will strengthen their squad as they navigate top-flight football for the first time.

      Banyana Banyana kicked off their Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) title defense with an impressive 2-0 win over Ghana this evening at the Honneur Stadium in Oujda.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The reigning champions showed poise and tactical discipline to secure three crucial points in their opening Group C clash.

        The match started under the scorching Moroccan sun, but South Africa quickly settled into their rhythm. In the 27th minute, midfielder Noxolo Cesane was brought down inside the box by Ghana's Grace Asantewaa. After a brief VAR check, the referee pointed to the spot. Linda Motlhalo confidently stepped up and slotted the penalty low into the right corner, sending the South African fans into jubilation.<br><br>
        Just six minutes later, Banyana Banyana doubled their lead. Lebohang Ramalepe's pinpoint through ball found Jermaine Seoposenwe, who calmly finished past Ghana goalkeeper Cynthia Konlan, leaving the Black Queens stunned.<br><br>
        Ghana responded in the second half, pressing hard and hitting the woodwork twice, but they could not break down a resilient Banyana defense marshaled by veteran Bambanani Mbane. Mbane's leadership was crucial in maintaining a clean sheet, earning her the Player of the Match honor.<br><br>
        Head coach Desiree Ellis praised her side's performance, especially their defensive discipline. "We knew keeping a clean sheet was key tonight, and the girls showed great composure in tough conditions," Ellis said post-match. "The heat was intense, but the team managed it well." <br><br>
        With this win, Banyana Banyana top Group C and will look to build on this momentum when they face Tanzania in their next match on Friday.<br> (Image By: Banyana Banyana/X)

      Cape Town – Once seen as a rising force in South African football, Cape Town City's journey in the Premiership has come to a painful halt.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        After a rollercoaster season filled with promise and setbacks, the Citizens' hopes were dashed by a narrow 1–0 loss to Orbit College in the promotion/relegation playoffs.The defeat not only ended City's fight to stay in the top flight but also crowned Orbit College with a historic promotion to the Premiership for the first time.<br><br>
         A season marked by coaching upheavals, key departures, and a damaging winless streak left City struggling to find form. Despite a late charge under the experienced Dutch coach Andries Ulderink, the comeback proved just out of reach. Supporters are left stunned, as their team now faces the tough task of regrouping and climbing back from the Motsepe Foundation Championship next season.<br><br>

      SuperSport United has been sold to Siwelele Football Club (Pty) Ltd in a deal valued at around R50 million, pending approval from the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        This marks the end of an era for the club, which has been a PSL mainstay since its founding in 1994.

        The sale comes as SuperSport International shifts its focus back to its core broadcasting business. CEO Rendani Ramovha explained that this move allows the company to remain Africa's biggest broadcaster.<br><br>
        Siwelele FC, led by chairman Calvin Le John, plans to relocate the team to Bloemfontein and rebrand the club, adopting the green-and-white colors once associated with Bloemfontein Celtic. However, due to naming rights, the club will compete as Siwelele FC.<br><br>
        While this transition opens new opportunities, fans and analysts express concerns about preserving the club's identity and community ties amid growing private ownership in South African football.<br><br>
        If approved, Siwelele FC will enter the 2025–26 PSL season under new ownership, marking a fresh start for the historic club.<br> (Image By: SupersportBets)
