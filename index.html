    <h2>UFS Clinch Historic Varsity Football Title in Nerve-Wracking Penalty Shootout</h2>

    <p>
The University of the Free State (UFS) etched their name into Varsity Football history on Thursday night, claiming their first-ever title after a dramatic 5-4 penalty shootout win over defending champions Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) at Shimla Park.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
A tightly contested final finished goalless after 90 intense minutes, sending the decider to penalties for a third consecutive year. With the scores level after four kicks each, TUT’s Lehlomo Tolo fired his effort over the crossbar – the only miss of the shootout – opening the door for UFS to seal a famous victory.
<br><br>
Substitute Theko Phinithi, who had replaced injured captain Iviwe Dyabuza in the first half, stepped up with nerves of steel to bury the final spot-kick and spark scenes of jubilation among the home supporters.
Fierce Battle in the City of Roses
The match kicked off at a blistering pace, with both teams clearly fired up for the occasion. UFS, making only their second appearance in a Varsity Football final, nearly took the lead early on through the lively Jerome Jansen, whose low drive whistled just past the post.
The turning point of the first half came in the 25th minute when UFS skipper Dyabuza and TUT’s midfield dynamo Lucky Raphala were forced off after a heavy collision. The double blow disrupted both teams’ rhythm but didn’t dampen the intensity.
<br><br>
Despite end-to-end action and a determined attacking display from the Kovsies in the second half, the deadlock could not be broken. TUT's backline, marshalled by captain Alan Moja, remained resolute under sustained pressure.
Penalty Drama Decides It
With the final deadlocked at 0-0, the contest headed to a shootout under the floodlights. Both teams converted their first two penalties with precision. The decisive moment came with TUT’s third attempt when Tolo ballooned his effort over the bar.
Though there was a brief moment of confusion among the home crowd – mistakenly celebrating a perceived miss by Kediwe Ncenya – UFS maintained their composure. Phinithi, showing remarkable calmness, slotted the final kick to seal a 5-4 triumph and UFS's maiden Varsity Football crown.
<br><br>
Individual Accolades Despite the defeat, TUT’s Surprise Khoza was named FNB Player of the Match for his relentless performance in midfield. The tournament’s top individual awards went elsewhere: NWU’s Ethan Mokwena earned the Cashbuild Golden Glove, while his teammate Aphelele Sibisi took home the FNB Player of the Tournament. The Suzuki Golden Boot was awarded to Keletso Sekhwela of UJ.

FIFA has sanctioned South Africa by deducting three points in their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. 

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The punishment follows a ruling that midfielder Teboho Mokoena was fielded while suspended in a match against Lesotho. The original 2–0 win was overturned, and Lesotho were awarded a 3–0 victory. In addition, South Africa has been fined 10,000 Swiss francs.

Orlando Pirates secured their fourth straight MTN8 title with a 3-0 extra-time victory over Stellenbosch FC at Mbombela Stadium on 13 September 2025.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The win marks a historic achievement, as the Buccaneers became the first club in the competition’s history to lift the trophy four times in a row.
<br><br>
After a tense 90 minutes without goals, Pirates dominated extra time. Tshepang Moremi broke the deadlock in the 92nd minute and later added another in the 110th. Tshegofatso Mabasa scored in between with a well-placed finish in the 103rd minute, sealing the result for the Soweto giants. The victory brings Orlando Pirates’ total MTN8 titles to 14, underlining their dominance in South African football. It was also the first major trophy under new head coach Abdeslam Ouaddou, who praised the team’s resilience and tactical discipline after the match.<br>
Stellenbosch, who reached the final for a second consecutive year, once again fell short against a clinical Pirates side. Despite their efforts, they were outclassed in extra time by a team with greater big-match experience.

    <h2>South Africa Ends 16‑Year Wait: Bafana Bafana Clinch 2026 World Cup Slot</h2>

    <p>
South Africa’s national football team, Bafana Bafana, has officially qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, marking their return to the global stage for the first time since 2010.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 The qualification ends a 16‑year absence from the tournament when they were automatic participants as hosts. 
<br><br>
Decisive Moment: Mbombela Seals the Deal The qualification was secured on 14 October 2025 at Mbombela Stadium, where South Africa defeated Rwanda 3‑0. Thalente Mbatha opened the scoring early, Oswin Appollis doubled the lead before halftime, and Evidence Makgopa capped the win with a second‑half goal. 
That victory allowed South Africa to finish top of Group C with 18 points, narrowly edging out Nigeria and Benin. Nigeria also won their final match 4‑0 against Benin, but South Africa’s superior goal margin and results carried them through. 
<br><br>
Challenges Along the Journey Points Deduction South Africa’s campaign was not without controversy. Earlier in the qualifiers, they fielded a suspended player, Teboho Mokoena, in a match against Lesotho. Because of this, FIFA penalised them by overturning a 2‑0 win and awarding Lesotho a 3‑0 win by forfeit. The ruling cost South Africa three points, which tightened the race in Group C.<br>
Unexpected Slip in the Home Stretch Before the decisive matchday, South Africa had built a solid lead. At one point they led Group C by five points with four matches to go. But draws at home—against Nigeria and Zimbabwe—combined with the points deduction, saw them fall behind Benin on goal difference before the final round. 
<br><br>
Historical Significance This will be South Africa’s fourth appearance at a FIFA World Cup finals: previously in 1998, 2002, and as hosts in 2010. It is the first time they have qualified on merit (i.e. through the qualifiers) since 2002. 
<br><br>
Reflections and What’s Next Coach Hugo Broos was quick to acknowledge the collective effort from the players, staff, and management. In his comments following the Rwanda match, he praised the discipline and consistency shown throughout the campaign. 
<br><br>
Looking forward, the 2026 World Cup expands to 48 teams, which gives nations like South Africa renewed hope and more room for opportunity. The team now aims to build on this qualification, preparing for the demands of the tournament alongside other high level competitions such as the Africa Cup of Nations. Confédération Africaine de Football +1<br>
Bafana Bafana’s qualification is more than just a return—it’s a statement. After years of ups and downs, administrative missteps, and narrow escapes, the national side has shown resilience. Next year, South Africa will represent Africa at the global stage, carrying both expectation and possibility.<br> (Image By: 📷Dirk Kotze/ Gallo Image)

The stage is set for a blockbuster semi-final round in the 2025 Varsity Women’s Football tournament after a decisive Round 3 concluded at UJ Soweto Stadium.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Reigning champions University of the Western Cape (UWC) continued their title defence in dominant fashion, while University of Johannesburg (UJ), Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), and University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) completed the semi-final line-up. Here’s how the action unfolded:
<br><br>
<b>UWC Marches On with Third Consecutive Win </b> 
<br><br>
UWC confirmed their place in the semi-finals with a clinical 2-0 victory over UP-Tuks. The defending champions showed their class early, as Chelsea Daniels headed home from a corner by Mmabatho Mogale in just the 7th minute. Despite some resistance from UP-Tuks, UWC maintained control throughout.<br><br>
Mogale, who was later named Player of the Match, doubled the lead in the 39th minute with a stunning goal directly from a corner — a rare feat that sealed the result and a perfect group stage campaign for UWC.
<br>

Wits Take Narrow Win Over Gritty CPUT </b> 
<br><br>
Wits made a winning start to their 2025 campaign with a gritty 1-0 win over CPUT in windy and physical conditions. The decisive moment came early, as Ayanda Mnyembane found the back of the net in the third minute following a clever through ball.<br><br>
Despite CPUT's attempts to equalise, including a powerful strike from Sinelisiwe Phumlomo in the 20th minute that forced a superb save from Wits goalkeeper Bridgette Moekwa, they couldn’t find a breakthrough. The match remained tense and competitive throughout, but Wits’ early goal and solid defensive shape ensured they left with maximum points.

<br><br>
UJ Women’s Football produced a commanding display in their 4-0 rout of CPUT, finishing the group stage unbeaten and atop Group B. Star striker Adivhaho Mphangale led from the front, scoring twice once from a header and once with a powerful strike just outside the box.<br><br>
Further goals from Thato Mofolo and substitute Malitsatsi Mosala — who converted a late penalty — ensured a convincing victory for the Orange Army. Midfielder Sthembile Msomi earned the Player of the Match award for her influential performance.

Thabiso Senyatsi and Naledi Thakanyane both netted hat-tricks, with TUT finding their rhythm at just the right time. Mokgaetji Ramanna and Lindiwe Nkambule added their names to the scoresheet as well, capping off a dominant team performance.

    <h2>Thabiso Monyane Replaces Injured Nyiko Mobbie in Bafana Bafana Squad Ahead of Crucial Nigeria Clash</h2>

    <p>
Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos has made a late change to his squad for the ongoing 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, calling up defender Thabiso Monyane to replace the injured Nyiko Mobbie.


      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Mobbie was forced off the field within the first five minutes of South Africa’s dominant 3-0 victory over Lesotho on Friday night at the Free State Stadium. The national team’s medical staff later confirmed the severity of his injury.
<br><br>
According to Bafana Bafana team doctor Tshepo Molobi, Mobbie sustained a triple fracture to the eye socket following a clash of heads early in the first half. He was immediately taken to hospital and underwent surgery on Saturday morning. "The injury happened as a result of a clash of heads in the first half and he sustained a fracture of the eye socket in three places," said Dr Molobi. "Further updates on his recovery will be provided after post-surgery evaluations."
<br><br>
In response, Broos has called up Thabiso Monyane, who will report to the national team camp in Bloemfontein this weekend as preparations continue for the high-stakes encounter against Nigeria on Tuesday night, also at the Free State Stadium.
<br><br>
There was also concern for Thabo Moloisane, who had to leave the field in the 52nd minute against Lesotho due to an injury. However, Dr Molobi provided a positive update, confirming that Moloisane is recovering well and is expected to return to training by Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
South Africa's convincing win over Lesotho keeps them firmly at the top of Group C, maintaining a five-point lead after five matches. Benin's 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe on the same day propelled them into second place with 11 points.

The Varsity Women’s Football 2025 tournament got underway at UJ Soweto Stadium with an action-packed Round 1.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Defending champions UWC battled past TUT in a tightly contested clash, UP-Tuks were ruthless against debutants UNIVEN, UJ delivered a commanding performance at home, and Wits edged a determined CPUT side. The opening round served up goals, standout performances, and early signs of who could emerge as contenders this season.<br><br>
<b>UWC Edges TUT in a Tense Opener </b> 
<br><br>
Defending champions UWC opened their campaign with a hard-earned 2-1 victory over TUT in a game that tested both sides’ resolve. UWC struck first through Zikhona Nogqala in the 22nd minute after a dominant start in possession. But their lead was short-lived, as TUT responded just two minutes later with a well-taken equaliser from Thabiso Senyatsi.<br><br>
The second half saw TUT pile on the pressure, dictating the pace and creating multiple chances. However, UWC’s defensive structure remained intact. The breakthrough came late in the game when Chelsea Daniels fired in a stunning long-range goal from the D-line to secure all three points for the Cape side.

Despite CPUT's attempts to equalise, including a powerful strike from Sinelisiwe Phumlomo in the 20th minute that forced a superb save from Wits goalkeeper Bridgette Moekwa, they couldn’t find a breakthrough.

     The Varsity Netball 2025 tournament delivered another round of high-octane performances, with the University of Johannesburg (UJ) ascending to the summit of the log following a commanding win over Varsity College.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Meanwhile, the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) pulled off an impressive upset against Madibaz, handing the latter their first defeat of the tournament.
<br><br>
UJ set the pace early against Varsity College, demonstrating sharp speed and precise passing to open up a lead, ending the first quarter at 14-8. Though Varsity College tightened their defence in the second quarter, UJ maintained composure to extend their halftime lead to 24-15. After the break, fresh legs from Varsity College sparked a brief resurgence, but UJ’s relentless pace and clinical finishing saw them pull away decisively, closing the match 56-34. Cornelia Mupenda was named player of the match for her consistent and commanding performance.
<br><br>
In another key fixture, NWU edged out Maties in a tightly contested encounter. The Eagles started strong with a 13-9 lead in the first quarter but saw momentum shift as Maties fought back in the second. Nevertheless, NWU regained their composure in the third quarter, building a substantial lead which they defended staunchly in the final quarter to secure a 55-41 victory. Vivian Venancio’s stellar play earned her player of the match honours.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, defending champions UFS Kovsies showcased their dominance in a comprehensive 73-37 thrashing of UP-Tuks. The Kovsies leveraged an aggressive defensive strategy to disrupt Tuks’ rhythm, establishing a comfortable lead early on. Liame de Lange anchored the defence and was named player of the match as Kovsies maintained their pace and precision throughout, reaffirming their status as tournament favourites.
<br><br>
The most dramatic showdown came when Wits stunned previously unbeaten Madibaz, inflicting their first loss of the season with a 63-50 victory. Wits led from start to finish, steadily increasing their advantage each quarter. Amber Marshall’s effortless scoring and tactical poise earned her player of the match, while Madibaz’s Hanniska van Vuuren and Kaylin Coetzer fought valiantly to keep their side in the contest. Despite a late surge by Madibaz in the third quarter, Wits maintained control and composure, sealing a well-deserved victory.

     In a tightly contested encounter, the Orange Army secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Wits, thanks to a decisive penalty converted by Tumelo Machete.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
This crucial goal handed the Orange Army the bragging rights as the kings of Joburg in this tournament.
Wits suffered their first loss of the competition, while the University of Johannesburg (UJ) recorded their second win from three matches, further strengthening their position in the tournament standings.<br><br>
A standout performer for UJ was Sinenhlanhla Mkhonza, who once again showcased his quality on the field and earned his consecutive FNB Player of the Match award. His consistent impact has been instrumental in UJ’s positive run in the tournament.

The match showcased intense competition, with both sides eager to assert dominance. However, it was the calm and composure of Tumelo Machete from the penalty spot that ultimately decided the outcome. The Orange Army’s defense held firm to maintain their slender lead until the final whistle.

Round 2 of the 2025 Varsity Football campaign delivered all the thrills fans could hope for 
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
with Wits, UJ, and NWU each collecting important victories to strengthen their early season positions. Meanwhile, the much-anticipated Tshwane derby between UP-Tuks and TUT ended in a dramatic goalless stalemate.<br><br>
<b>Wits Outclass DUT at Home</b> <br><br>
Wits continued their strong start to the season with a confident 2-0 win over Durban University of Technology (DUT) at a buzzing Wits Stadium. Following their emphatic 4-1 victory against CUT in the opening round, the Cleverboys showed their intent early on and dominated possession.
Prince Manku opened the scoring with a long-range stunner in first-half stoppage time, after a clever assist by Tebogo Masemola. DUT responded with greater intensity in the second half, but Wits’ defense, anchored by goalkeeper Lwando Mvinjana, held firm. Masemola later turned scorer to seal the win, finishing off a rare assist from his own goalkeeper. Player of the Match, Kgwadi Molepo, was instrumental in Wits’ control of the midfield.<br>
<i>Final Score: Wits 2–0 DUT</i><br>

<b>Sibisi Leads NWU to Victory</b> <br><br>
NWU edged CUT 1-0 in a hard-fought clash, thanks to a captain’s goal from Aphelele Sibisi in the 57th minute. After a goalless first half where NWU dominated but failed to convert their chances, the breakthrough came via a well-timed header from Sibisi following a precise cross from the right.
NWU managed the rest of the game with maturity, controlling possession and shutting down CUT's efforts to equalize. Momelezi Mngati was named Player of the Match for his outstanding contribution in midfield.<br>

<b>Late Drama as UJ Snatch Win Over UFS </b> <br><br>
In Bloemfontein, UJ left it late to steal a 1-0 win over the University of the Free State (UFS). With the game seemingly heading for a draw, striker Keletso Sekhwela rose highest in the 93rd minute to nod in a match-winning goal from a corner kick.
UFS had moments of promise, especially through winger Samkelo Nakedi, but couldn’t break down a resilient UJ side. UJ’s Sinenhlanhla Mkhonza delivered a standout performance in midfield and was deservedly named Player of the Match.<br>

<b>Tshwane Derby Ends in Goalless Draw </b> <br><br>
One of the biggest fixtures of the round saw city rivals UP-Tuks and TUT share the spoils in a tense 0-0 draw at Tuks Stadium. Both sides created chances, but failed to convert, with goalkeepers and defensive units standing tall throughout.
Tuks’ star striker Samukelo Ngodela and TUT’s Menzukuthula Ntshangase both missed golden opportunities, while a late goal by substitute Mathuane Selotola was ruled offside, denying Tuks a dramatic winner. Defender Edward Rankwe of UP-Tuks earned Player of the Match honors for his composure at the back.<br>

The 2025 Varsity Football season launched with excitement and intensity as university teams across the country battled in Round 1 of the highly anticipated competition.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Wits University and Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) stood out with strong opening performances, each claiming important wins to set the tone for their campaigns.<br><br>
<b>Wits Mark Their Return with Dominant Win</b> <br><br>
Returning to the competition after a two-year absence, Wits University delivered a commanding performance at Wits Rugby Stadium, defeating Central University of Technology (CUT) 4-1.
Tebogo Masemola opened the scoring after a smart assist from Simphiwe Mabena, while a red card to CUT’s Malefetsane Doctor Matale before halftime left the visitors at a disadvantage. Wits capitalized in the second half, adding goals from Sfiso Mlondo, Mxolisi Mthiya, and Mabena. CUT’s Nkosingiphile Lubisi managed a late consolation, but Wits had already sealed a convincing victory.<br>

<b>TUT Spoil DUT's Debut with Early Strike</b><br><br>
TUT edged a determined DUT side 1-0 at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg, denying the newcomers a dream debut.
Precious Mohale gave TUT the lead in the seventh minute, and although DUT pushed hard — including a missed penalty brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Sekwanele Mtolo — they couldn’t find a way back. TUT’s defensive resilience and game management saw them secure all three points.<br>

<b>Late Equalizer Earns NWU Draw Against UJ</b><br><br>
At UJ Stadium, hosts University of Johannesburg (UJ) were held to a 1-1 draw by North-West University (NWU) in a high-energy encounter.
UJ struck early, with Thabo Moshikere scoring in the third minute after a clever assist from Yasidu Lifa. Despite holding the lead for much of the match, UJ couldn’t close it out. Molemo Kukama found the equalizer in the 89th minute for NWU, snatching a point in the dying moments.<br>

     Chippa United head coach Sinethemba Badela has set out a clear vision for the 2025/26 DStv Premiership season — to win matches while playing a brand of football that excites fans.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Speaking ahead of the campaign, Badela made it clear that his ambitions for the team go beyond simply surviving in the top flight. He wants the Chilli Boys to be competitive, entertaining, and progressive in their approach.<br><br>
“We are looking to try and win as many matches as we can,” said Badela. “We are also looking forward to being an exciting team to watch.”
Now heading into his second full season in charge, the 34-year-old coach is overseeing a period of growth and transformation at the club. Chippa United have brought in new signings over the off-season and have placed a strong focus on tactical development, youth integration, and consistent performances.
“Chippa United are a growing team,” Badela continued. “We want to play attractive football — not just for entertainment, but because it’s part of our identity and it can bring long-term results.”<br><br>
Badela is part of a new generation of South African coaches bringing fresh ideas to the game. His philosophy emphasizes structure, intelligent pressing, and ball movement — a clear shift from the club’s historically pragmatic style. Those within the club say he has already had a positive influence on the players' mindset and the overall team culture.
The technical team has worked hard in pre-season to prepare for what is expected to be a highly competitive league campaign. New players have been recruited not only for their experience but also for their ability to fit into a dynamic system aimed at controlling games and creating chances.<br><br>
Chippa United will face early tests against some of the Premiership’s stronger sides, but the mood in the camp is one of quiet confidence. With a clearly defined identity and a coach who believes in building something sustainable, the club hopes to turn heads for the right reasons this season.

    <h2>Yusuf Maart Completes European Move from Kaizer Chiefs to SV Ried</h2>

      Yusuf Maart has officially completed a transfer from Kaizer Chiefs to Austrian Bundesliga club SV Ried, marking a significant step in the midfielder’s career as he moves abroad for the first time at the age of 29.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The deal was confirmed earlier this week after weeks of speculation, with the South African international set to join Ried ahead of the 2025–26 Austrian season.

The move brings an end to Maart’s three-year spell at Kaizer Chiefs, where he served as club captain and became a fan favourite through his leadership and consistent performances in midfield. Chiefs reportedly exercised a one-year extension clause in his contract in June but ultimately agreed to release him for a transfer fee of approximately €1 million. While Transfermarkt also lists Maart’s market value at €1 million, multiple reports confirm that SV Ried reached an agreement to secure the player on a permanent deal.<br><br>
Maart made 95 appearances in all competitions for Amakhosi, scoring seven goals and assisting eight. His most iconic moment came in May 2025 when he scored the winning goal in the Nedbank Cup final, ending the club’s ten-year trophy drought. His farewell message to the club and supporters was emotional, as he thanked teammates, coaches, and fans for standing by him through highs and lows. He described Kaizer Chiefs as a place that will “always be home.”<br><br>
Now entering a new phase of his career, Maart arrives at SV Ried as the club prepares for its return to the Austrian top flight. In his unveiling, the midfielder said he was excited by the challenge of playing in Europe and grateful for the opportunity. He acknowledged the physical nature of Austrian football and committed to adapting quickly to make a strong impact. SV Ried’s management praised Maart’s technical ability, international experience, and leadership qualities.<br><br>
Kaizer Chiefs, meanwhile, have already named Angolan international Miguel Inacio as the club’s new captain. The club is expected to reinforce its midfield during the transfer window as it prepares for both domestic competition and its upcoming CAF Confederation Cup campaign.<br><br>

      Banyana Banyana are back in action tonight as they face Tanzania in a pivotal Group C match at the 2025 CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Oujda, Morocco.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The match kicks off at 21:00 South African time at the Honneur Stadium, with South Africa looking to make it two wins from two and edge closer to a place in the quarterfinals.<br><br>
        Linda Motlhalo scored from the penalty spot and Jermaine Seoposenwe added a second in South Africa's opening 2–0 win over Ghana. Speaking ahead of the Tanzania clash, coach Desiree Ellis said: "Yes, we have played Tanzania before, but that goes out of the window — it means nothing. We must make sure we don't concede. We are going to create opportunities, and we need to take those opportunities and be more effective in the attacking third."<br><br>
        Tanzania are coming off a narrow defeat to Mali and are under pressure to get a result. South Africa, meanwhile, know a second win would put them in control of the group with one game remaining.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">

      Banyana Banyana kicked off their Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) title defense with an impressive 2-0 win over Ghana this evening at the Honneur Stadium in Oujda.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The reigning champions showed poise and tactical discipline to secure three crucial points in their opening Group C clash.

        The match started under the scorching Moroccan sun, but South Africa quickly settled into their rhythm. In the 27th minute, midfielder Noxolo Cesane was brought down inside the box by Ghana's Grace Asantewaa. After a brief VAR check, the referee pointed to the spot. Linda Motlhalo confidently stepped up and slotted the penalty low into the right corner, sending the South African fans into jubilation.<br><br>
        Just six minutes later, Banyana Banyana doubled their lead. Lebohang Ramalepe's pinpoint through ball found Jermaine Seoposenwe, who calmly finished past Ghana goalkeeper Cynthia Konlan, leaving the Black Queens stunned.<br><br>
        Ghana responded in the second half, pressing hard and hitting the woodwork twice, but they could not break down a resilient Banyana defense marshaled by veteran Bambanani Mbane. Mbane's leadership was crucial in maintaining a clean sheet, earning her the Player of the Match honor.<br><br>
        Head coach Desiree Ellis praised her side's performance, especially their defensive discipline. "We knew keeping a clean sheet was key tonight, and the girls showed great composure in tough conditions," Ellis said post-match. "The heat was intense, but the team managed it well." <br><br>
        With this win, Banyana Banyana top Group C and will look to build on this momentum when they face Tanzania in their next match on Friday.<br> (Image By: 📷Banyana Banyana/X)

      Cape Town – Once seen as a rising force in South African football, Cape Town City's journey in the Premiership has come to a painful halt.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        After a rollercoaster season filled with promise and setbacks, the Citizens' hopes were dashed by a narrow 1–0 loss to Orbit College in the promotion/relegation playoffs.The defeat not only ended City's fight to stay in the top flight but also crowned Orbit College with a historic promotion to the Premiership for the first time.<br><br>
         A season marked by coaching upheavals, key departures, and a damaging winless streak left City struggling to find form. Despite a late charge under the experienced Dutch coach Andries Ulderink, the comeback proved just out of reach. Supporters are left stunned, as their team now faces the tough task of regrouping and climbing back from the Motsepe Foundation Championship next season.<br><br>

      SuperSport United has been sold to Siwelele Football Club (Pty) Ltd in a deal valued at around R50 million, pending approval from the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        This marks the end of an era for the club, which has been a PSL mainstay since its founding in 1994.

        The sale comes as SuperSport International shifts its focus back to its core broadcasting business. CEO Rendani Ramovha explained that this move allows the company to remain Africa's biggest broadcaster.<br><br>
        Siwelele FC, led by chairman Calvin Le John, plans to relocate the team to Bloemfontein and rebrand the club, adopting the green-and-white colors once associated with Bloemfontein Celtic. However, due to naming rights, the club will compete as Siwelele FC.<br><br>
        While this transition opens new opportunities, fans and analysts express concerns about preserving the club's identity and community ties amid growing private ownership in South African football.<br><br>
        If approved, Siwelele FC will enter the 2025–26 PSL season under new ownership, marking a fresh start for the historic club.<br> (Image By: 📷SupersportBets)

The stage is set for a blockbuster semi-final round in the 2025 Varsity Women’s Football tournament after a decisive Round 3 concluded at UJ Soweto Stadium.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Reigning champions University of the Western Cape (UWC) continued their title defence in dominant fashion, while University of Johannesburg (UJ), Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), and University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) completed the semi-final line-up. Here’s how the action unfolded:
<br><br>
<b>UWC Marches On with Third Consecutive Win </b> 
<br><br>
UWC confirmed their place in the semi-finals with a clinical 2-0 victory over UP-Tuks. The defending champions showed their class early, as Chelsea Daniels headed home from a corner by Mmabatho Mogale in just the 7th minute. Despite some resistance from UP-Tuks, UWC maintained control throughout.<br><br>
Mogale, who was later named Player of the Match, doubled the lead in the 39th minute with a stunning goal directly from a corner — a rare feat that sealed the result and a perfect group stage campaign for UWC.
<br>
<i>Final Score: (UWC 2-0 UP-Tuks)</i><br>

Despite CPUT's attempts to equalise, including a powerful strike from Sinelisiwe Phumlomo in the 20th minute that forced a superb save from Wits goalkeeper Bridgette Moekwa, they couldn’t find a breakthrough. The match remained tense and competitive throughout, but Wits’ early goal and solid defensive shape ensured they left with maximum points.

Further goals from Thato Mofolo and substitute Malitsatsi Mosala — who converted a late penalty — ensured a convincing victory for the Orange Army. Midfielder Sthembile Msomi earned the Player of the Match award for her influential performance.

    <h2>Thabiso Monyane Replaces Injured Nyiko Mobbie in Bafana Bafana Squad Ahead of Crucial Nigeria Clash</h2>

    <p>
Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos has made a late change to his squad for the ongoing 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, calling up defender Thabiso Monyane to replace the injured Nyiko Mobbie.


      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Mobbie was forced off the field within the first five minutes of South Africa’s dominant 3-0 victory over Lesotho on Friday night at the Free State Stadium. The national team’s medical staff later confirmed the severity of his injury.
<br><br>
According to Bafana Bafana team doctor Tshepo Molobi, Mobbie sustained a triple fracture to the eye socket following a clash of heads early in the first half. He was immediately taken to hospital and underwent surgery on Saturday morning. "The injury happened as a result of a clash of heads in the first half and he sustained a fracture of the eye socket in three places," said Dr Molobi. "Further updates on his recovery will be provided after post-surgery evaluations."
<br><br>
In response, Broos has called up Thabiso Monyane, who will report to the national team camp in Bloemfontein this weekend as preparations continue for the high-stakes encounter against Nigeria on Tuesday night, also at the Free State Stadium.
<br><br>
There was also concern for Thabo Moloisane, who had to leave the field in the 52nd minute against Lesotho due to an injury. However, Dr Molobi provided a positive update, confirming that Moloisane is recovering well and is expected to return to training by Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
South Africa's convincing win over Lesotho keeps them firmly at the top of Group C, maintaining a five-point lead after five matches. Benin's 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe on the same day propelled them into second place with 11 points.
<br><br>

The Varsity Women’s Football 2025 tournament got underway at UJ Soweto Stadium with an action-packed Round 1.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Defending champions UWC battled past TUT in a tightly contested clash, UP-Tuks were ruthless against debutants UNIVEN, UJ delivered a commanding performance at home, and Wits edged a determined CPUT side. The opening round served up goals, standout performances, and early signs of who could emerge as contenders this season.<br><br>
<b>UWC Edges TUT in a Tense Opener </b> 
<br><br>
Defending champions UWC opened their campaign with a hard-earned 2-1 victory over TUT in a game that tested both sides’ resolve. UWC struck first through Zikhona Nogqala in the 22nd minute after a dominant start in possession. But their lead was short-lived, as TUT responded just two minutes later with a well-taken equaliser from Thabiso Senyatsi.<br><br>
The second half saw TUT pile on the pressure, dictating the pace and creating multiple chances. However, UWC’s defensive structure remained intact. The breakthrough came late in the game when Chelsea Daniels fired in a stunning long-range goal from the D-line to secure all three points for the Cape side.

UP-Tuks Thrash UNIVEN in Dominant Display
</b> 
<br><br>
It was a baptism of fire for newcomers UNIVEN, who took a surprise lead against UP-Tuks through Andani Dabana in the 14th minute. The joy was short-lived, though, as Tuks quickly regained control and launched a relentless offensive.<br><br>
Nonhlakanipho Lucy Filand equalised just past the half-hour mark, and Sbahle Ndlovu added a quick second to give Tuks a 2-1 lead at the break. Ndlovu completed her brace early in the second half, Moeletsi Digoro extended the lead with a sharp finish, and substitute Rethabile Makhwela capped off the performance with a powerful header from a corner.

<br><br>
From there, it was the Thato Mofolo show. The forward netted a brilliant hat-trick, finishing chances with clinical precision and putting the result beyond doubt. Coach Nthabeleng Modiko used the second half to rotate the squad, showing confidence in her depth as the tournament progresses.

     The Varsity Netball 2025 tournament delivered another round of high-octane performances, with the University of Johannesburg (UJ) ascending to the summit of the log following a commanding win over Varsity College.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Meanwhile, the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) pulled off an impressive upset against Madibaz, handing the latter their first defeat of the tournament.
<br><br>
UJ set the pace early against Varsity College, demonstrating sharp speed and precise passing to open up a lead, ending the first quarter at 14-8. Though Varsity College tightened their defence in the second quarter, UJ maintained composure to extend their halftime lead to 24-15. After the break, fresh legs from Varsity College sparked a brief resurgence, but UJ’s relentless pace and clinical finishing saw them pull away decisively, closing the match 56-34. Cornelia Mupenda was named player of the match for her consistent and commanding performance.
<br><br>
In another key fixture, NWU edged out Maties in a tightly contested encounter. The Eagles started strong with a 13-9 lead in the first quarter but saw momentum shift as Maties fought back in the second. Nevertheless, NWU regained their composure in the third quarter, building a substantial lead which they defended staunchly in the final quarter to secure a 55-41 victory. Vivian Venancio’s stellar play earned her player of the match honours.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, defending champions UFS Kovsies showcased their dominance in a comprehensive 73-37 thrashing of UP-Tuks. The Kovsies leveraged an aggressive defensive strategy to disrupt Tuks’ rhythm, establishing a comfortable lead early on. Liame de Lange anchored the defence and was named player of the match as Kovsies maintained their pace and precision throughout, reaffirming their status as tournament favourites.
<br><br>
The most dramatic showdown came when Wits stunned previously unbeaten Madibaz, inflicting their first loss of the season with a 63-50 victory. Wits led from start to finish, steadily increasing their advantage each quarter. Amber Marshall’s effortless scoring and tactical poise earned her player of the match, while Madibaz’s Hanniska van Vuuren and Kaylin Coetzer fought valiantly to keep their side in the contest. Despite a late surge by Madibaz in the third quarter, Wits maintained control and composure, sealing a well-deserved victory.

Round 2 of the 2025 Varsity Football campaign delivered all the thrills fans could hope for 
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
with Wits, UJ, and NWU each collecting important victories to strengthen their early season positions. Meanwhile, the much-anticipated Tshwane derby between UP-Tuks and TUT ended in a dramatic goalless stalemate.<br><br>
<b>Wits Outclass DUT at Home</b> <br><br>
Wits continued their strong start to the season with a confident 2-0 win over Durban University of Technology (DUT) at a buzzing Wits Stadium. Following their emphatic 4-1 victory against CUT in the opening round, the Cleverboys showed their intent early on and dominated possession.
Prince Manku opened the scoring with a long-range stunner in first-half stoppage time, after a clever assist by Tebogo Masemola. DUT responded with greater intensity in the second half, but Wits’ defense, anchored by goalkeeper Lwando Mvinjana, held firm. Masemola later turned scorer to seal the win, finishing off a rare assist from his own goalkeeper. Player of the Match, Kgwadi Molepo, was instrumental in Wits’ control of the midfield.<br>

NWU managed the rest of the game with maturity, controlling possession and shutting down CUT's efforts to equalize. Momelezi Mngati was named Player of the Match for his outstanding contribution in midfield.<br>

<b>Late Drama as UJ Snatch Win Over UFS </b> <br><br>
In Bloemfontein, UJ left it late to steal a 1-0 win over the University of the Free State (UFS). With the game seemingly heading for a draw, striker Keletso Sekhwela rose highest in the 93rd minute to nod in a match-winning goal from a corner kick.
UFS had moments of promise, especially through winger Samkelo Nakedi, but couldn’t break down a resilient UJ side. UJ’s Sinenhlanhla Mkhonza delivered a standout performance in midfield and was deservedly named Player of the Match.<br>

The 2025 Varsity Football season launched with excitement and intensity as university teams across the country battled in Round 1 of the highly anticipated competition.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Wits University and Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) stood out with strong opening performances, each claiming important wins to set the tone for their campaigns.<br><br>
<b>Wits Mark Their Return with Dominant Win</b> <br><br>
Returning to the competition after a two-year absence, Wits University delivered a commanding performance at Wits Rugby Stadium, defeating Central University of Technology (CUT) 4-1.
Tebogo Masemola opened the scoring after a smart assist from Simphiwe Mabena, while a red card to CUT’s Malefetsane Doctor Matale before halftime left the visitors at a disadvantage. Wits capitalized in the second half, adding goals from Sfiso Mlondo, Mxolisi Mthiya, and Mabena. CUT’s Nkosingiphile Lubisi managed a late consolation, but Wits had already sealed a convincing victory.<br>
<i>Player of the Match: Kgwadi Molepo (Wits)</i><br><br>
<b>TUT Spoil DUT's Debut with Early Strike</b><br><br>
TUT edged a determined DUT side 1-0 at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg, denying the newcomers a dream debut.
Precious Mohale gave TUT the lead in the seventh minute, and although DUT pushed hard — including a missed penalty brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Sekwanele Mtolo — they couldn’t find a way back. TUT’s defensive resilience and game management saw them secure all three points.<br>
<i>Player of the Match: Sphesihle Mazibuko (TUT)</i><br><br>
<b>Late Equalizer Earns NWU Draw Against UJ</b><br><br>
At UJ Stadium, hosts University of Johannesburg (UJ) were held to a 1-1 draw by North-West University (NWU) in a high-energy encounter.
UJ struck early, with Thabo Moshikere scoring in the third minute after a clever assist from Yasidu Lifa. Despite holding the lead for much of the match, UJ couldn’t close it out. Molemo Kukama found the equalizer in the 89th minute for NWU, snatching a point in the dying moments.<br>

     Chippa United head coach Sinethemba Badela has set out a clear vision for the 2025/26 DStv Premiership season — to win matches while playing a brand of football that excites fans.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Speaking ahead of the campaign, Badela made it clear that his ambitions for the team go beyond simply surviving in the top flight. He wants the Chilli Boys to be competitive, entertaining, and progressive in their approach.<br><br>
“We are looking to try and win as many matches as we can,” said Badela. “We are also looking forward to being an exciting team to watch.”
Now heading into his second full season in charge, the 34-year-old coach is overseeing a period of growth and transformation at the club. Chippa United have brought in new signings over the off-season and have placed a strong focus on tactical development, youth integration, and consistent performances.
“Chippa United are a growing team,” Badela continued. “We want to play attractive football — not just for entertainment, but because it’s part of our identity and it can bring long-term results.”<br><br>
Badela is part of a new generation of South African coaches bringing fresh ideas to the game. His philosophy emphasizes structure, intelligent pressing, and ball movement — a clear shift from the club’s historically pragmatic style. Those within the club say he has already had a positive influence on the players' mindset and the overall team culture.
The technical team has worked hard in pre-season to prepare for what is expected to be a highly competitive league campaign. New players have been recruited not only for their experience but also for their ability to fit into a dynamic system aimed at controlling games and creating chances.<br><br>
Chippa United will face early tests against some of the Premiership’s stronger sides, but the mood in the camp is one of quiet confidence. With a clearly defined identity and a coach who believes in building something sustainable, the club hopes to turn heads for the right reasons this season.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
AmaZulu FC’s MTN8 campaign came to a heartbreaking end as they were beaten 3–2 after extra time by Stellenbosch FC at the DHL Stadium.
Keagan Allen gave AmaZulu an early lead, capitalising on a defensive scramble to open the scoring. But Stellenbosch responded through a brace from Sanele Barns—his second a brilliant free kick—to put the home side ahead.<br><br>
Tebogo Mashigo levelled the tie again in the 73rd minute, forcing extra time in a thrilling encounter.
The decisive blow came in the 108th minute when former AmaZulu academy product Langelihle Phili curled in a stunning winner against his old club.
After the match, AmaZulu coach Arthur Zwane admitted his side lost focus when it mattered most.<br><br>
“We took the foot off the pedal,” said Zwane. “You can’t afford that in knockout football.”

     Orlando Pirates captain Nkosinathi Sibisi says his team is focused and ready to defend their MTN8 title as they prepare to face Polokwane City in a tough quarter-final showdown.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Sibisi, who recently took over the captaincy from Innocent Maela, is embracing the challenge and believes the Buccaneers are prepared for battle.
“We want to defend what’s ours,” he told the SABC. “It won’t be easy — we know how tough Polokwane City can be — but we’re confident, especially at home.”
Pirates edged Polokwane City 1-0 in their most recent encounter last season, with Sibisi himself scoring the winner. That result adds to their confidence going into the weekend, but the captain isn’t taking anything for granted.<br><br>
Meanwhile, Polokwane City defender Tlou Nkwe is well aware of the challenge his side faces but insists they are ready.
“It’s never easy playing the defending champions away,” said Nkwe. “But we’ve prepared well, and we’re ready to step up.”

    <h2>Yusuf Maart Completes European Move from Kaizer Chiefs to SV Ried</h2>
    <h6 class="dateandauthor">By Azola Ngxanga | 15 July 2025</span></h6>

    <p>
      Yusuf Maart has officially completed a transfer from Kaizer Chiefs to Austrian Bundesliga club SV Ried, marking a significant step in the midfielder’s career as he moves abroad for the first time at the age of 29.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The deal was confirmed earlier this week after weeks of speculation, with the South African international set to join Ried ahead of the 2025–26 Austrian season.

The move brings an end to Maart’s three-year spell at Kaizer Chiefs, where he served as club captain and became a fan favourite through his leadership and consistent performances in midfield. Chiefs reportedly exercised a one-year extension clause in his contract in June but ultimately agreed to release him for a transfer fee of approximately €1 million. While Transfermarkt also lists Maart’s market value at €1 million, multiple reports confirm that SV Ried reached an agreement to secure the player on a permanent deal.<br><br>
Maart made 95 appearances in all competitions for Amakhosi, scoring seven goals and assisting eight. His most iconic moment came in May 2025 when he scored the winning goal in the Nedbank Cup final, ending the club’s ten-year trophy drought. His farewell message to the club and supporters was emotional, as he thanked teammates, coaches, and fans for standing by him through highs and lows. He described Kaizer Chiefs as a place that will “always be home.”<br><br>
Now entering a new phase of his career, Maart arrives at SV Ried as the club prepares for its return to the Austrian top flight. In his unveiling, the midfielder said he was excited by the challenge of playing in Europe and grateful for the opportunity. He acknowledged the physical nature of Austrian football and committed to adapting quickly to make a strong impact. SV Ried’s management praised Maart’s technical ability, international experience, and leadership qualities.<br><br>
Kaizer Chiefs, meanwhile, have already named Angolan international Miguel Inacio as the club’s new captain. The club is expected to reinforce its midfield during the transfer window as it prepares for both domestic competition and its upcoming CAF Confederation Cup campaign.<br><br>

        Linda Motlhalo scored from the penalty spot and Jermaine Seoposenwe added a second in South Africa's opening 2–0 win over Ghana. Speaking ahead of the Tanzania clash, coach Desiree Ellis said: "Yes, we have played Tanzania before, but that goes out of the window — it means nothing. We must make sure we don't concede. We are going to create opportunities, and we need to take those opportunities and be more effective in the attacking third."<br><br>
        Tanzania are coming off a narrow defeat to Mali and are under pressure to get a result. South Africa, meanwhile, know a second win would put them in control of the group with one game remaining.

      Banyana Banyana kicked off their Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) title defense with an impressive 2-0 win over Ghana this evening at the Honneur Stadium in Oujda.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The reigning champions showed poise and tactical discipline to secure three crucial points in their opening Group C clash.

        The match started under the scorching Moroccan sun, but South Africa quickly settled into their rhythm. In the 27th minute, midfielder Noxolo Cesane was brought down inside the box by Ghana's Grace Asantewaa. After a brief VAR check, the referee pointed to the spot. Linda Motlhalo confidently stepped up and slotted the penalty low into the right corner, sending the South African fans into jubilation.<br><br>
        Just six minutes later, Banyana Banyana doubled their lead. Lebohang Ramalepe's pinpoint through ball found Jermaine Seoposenwe, who calmly finished past Ghana goalkeeper Cynthia Konlan, leaving the Black Queens stunned.<br><br>
        Ghana responded in the second half, pressing hard and hitting the woodwork twice, but they could not break down a resilient Banyana defense marshaled by veteran Bambanani Mbane. Mbane's leadership was crucial in maintaining a clean sheet, earning her the Player of the Match honor.<br><br>
        Head coach Desiree Ellis praised her side's performance, especially their defensive discipline. "We knew keeping a clean sheet was key tonight, and the girls showed great composure in tough conditions," Ellis said post-match. "The heat was intense, but the team managed it well." <br><br>
        With this win, Banyana Banyana top Group C and will look to build on this momentum when they face Tanzania in their next match on Friday.<br> (Image By: 📷Banyana Banyana/X)

While their Club World Cup journey may have ended sooner than hoped, Mamelodi Sundowns return home with plenty to be proud of.<br> (Image By:📷 Backpageix)

      Chelsea FC have signed Camden Cesc Schaper, a 13-year-old midfield sensation from Benoni, South Africa, in a deal worth R17 million (£700,000) — a record fee for a player his age.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">

        He attracted interest from top clubs including Manchester City and Liverpool, but Chelsea won the race to sign him. He's also sponsored by Adidas.<br><br>

      Cape Town – Once seen as a rising force in South African football, Cape Town City's journey in the Premiership has come to a painful halt.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        After a rollercoaster season filled with promise and setbacks, the Citizens' hopes were dashed by a narrow 1–0 loss to Orbit College in the promotion/relegation playoffs.The defeat not only ended City's fight to stay in the top flight but also crowned Orbit College with a historic promotion to the Premiership for the first time.<br><br>
         A season marked by coaching upheavals, key departures, and a damaging winless streak left City struggling to find form. Despite a late charge under the experienced Dutch coach Andries Ulderink, the comeback proved just out of reach. Supporters are left stunned, as their team now faces the tough task of regrouping and climbing back from the Motsepe Foundation Championship next season.<br><br>
        Meanwhile, Orbit College's fairy-tale rise has captured the imagination of fans, setting the stage for fresh battles in South African football's elite league. <br>(Image By:📷 Cape Town City/X)

    <h2>SuperSport United Sold to New Owners: A New Chapter Begins</h2>

      SuperSport United has been sold to Siwelele Football Club (Pty) Ltd in a deal valued at around R50 million, pending approval from the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        This marks the end of an era for the club, which has been a PSL mainstay since its founding in 1994.

        The sale comes as SuperSport International shifts its focus back to its core broadcasting business. CEO Rendani Ramovha explained that this move allows the company to remain Africa's biggest broadcaster.<br><br>
        Siwelele FC, led by chairman Calvin Le John, plans to relocate the team to Bloemfontein and rebrand the club, adopting the green-and-white colors once associated with Bloemfontein Celtic. However, due to naming rights, the club will compete as Siwelele FC.<br><br>
        While this transition opens new opportunities, fans and analysts express concerns about preserving the club's identity and community ties amid growing private ownership in South African football.<br><br>
        If approved, Siwelele FC will enter the 2025–26 PSL season under new ownership, marking a fresh start for the historic club.<br> (Image By: 📷SupersportBets)
