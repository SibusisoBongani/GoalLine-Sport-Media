Orlando Pirates responded after halftime, reducing the deficit through Patrick Maswanganyi, who found the net shortly after the restart to revive hopes of a comeback.<br><br>

The 2026 season burst into action with a spectacular opening round packed with high scores, dramatic comebacks and statement victories across the country, as teams wasted no time showcasing their attacking intent.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
<b>Shimlas outlast Maties in Bloemfontein thriller</b><br><br>
FNB UFS Shimlas secured one of the standout wins of the round, defeating FNB Maties 50-39 in a thrilling, high-tempo clash at Shimla Park. The hosts stormed into a commanding 21-0 lead inside the opening 25 minutes through Kirwin du Preez, Wynand Botha and Jaco Bezuidenhout. Maties fought back strongly before the break, with CJ Marx scoring the tournament's first-ever powerplay (tap) try to help reduce the deficit to just four points at half-time.<br><br>
Momentum continued to swing in a breathless second half. Maties briefly edged ahead through Christiaan van Heerden Smith and Armand Combrinck, but Shimlas responded with authority. Lock Maynard Kleynhans produced a memorable finish down the touchline, while Liam Shamburg capped a superb performance with a try that secured Player of the Match honours.<br><br>
Late scores from CJ Erasmus and Zuko Poswa kept Maties in contention, but Shimlas held firm to seal a memorable opening-night victory. The occasion carried added significance as the hosts honoured to late Oom Tat Botha and former Springbok hooker Wessel Lightfoot.<br><br>
<b>UP-Tuks power past defending champions</b><br><br>
FNB UP-Tuks delivered a composed and clinical performance to defeat defending champions FNB UCT Ikeys 38-22 in Pretoria. The visitors struck early through Lezane Davis, but Tuks quickly found their rhythm, with captain Dillon Smith responding before winger Andile Myeni turned the match decisively with a quick-fire brace. Abel Pretorius extended the lead from a driving maul to give the hosts a 28-17 advantage at half-time.<br><br>
Tuks controlled the second half with maturity. Kobus Janse van Rensburg crossed to stretch the lead before Aiden Norris replied for the visitors. Fullback Hopewell Ntshangase sealed the victory late on to complete an impressive comeback win. Flyhalf Divan du Toit was named Player of the Match after directing play with authority.<br><br>
<b>UJ surge after break to overpower Emeris</b><br><br>
FNB UJ produced a dominant second-half display to secure a 61-41 victory over newly promoted FNB Emeris in Johannesburg. The first half was evenly contested, with Emeris leading 21-19 thanks to a brace from Nkazimulo Mzolo and a try from Jacques Marais. UJ remained composed, with Ughan Africa, Reuven Ferreira and captain Thabang Mphafi keeping the hosts within striking distance.<br><br>
After the interval, UJ took full control. Flyhalf Nicallen Gabrielsen scored, converted his own try and added a penalty to put his side ahead, before the forward pack took over. Rolling maul tries from Kamo Molefe, Ryan Marimo and Josh du Toit stretched the advantage beyond reach.<br><br>
Emeris added late scores, but UJ finished strongly through Tholithemba Sobisi and another from Du Toit. Zian Cilliers was named Player of the Match after an influential all-round display.<br><br>
<b>NWU Eagles complete comeback in Bloemfontein shoot-out</b><br><br>
FNB NWU Eagles staged a powerful second-half comeback to defeat FNB CUT 59-42 in another try-filled encounter. CUT dominated large periods of the first half, racing into a 31-14 lead through tries from Jade Muller, Winton Abrahams and Raydon Swartblooi, along with a powerplay score from Malcolm Lamont.<br><br>
However, the visitors responded emphatically after the break. Jordan McLoughlin completed his brace to spark the turnaround before winger Therlow Prins stole the spotlight with a scintillating hat-trick. Further tries from Stephan Krugel, Guhan du Bois and Hanro Venter sealed a commanding victory for the Potchefstroom outfit. Despite the defeat, CUT showed encouraging improvement, while Kehan Myburgh earned Player of the Match recognition.<br><br>
<b>Attacking rugby sets the tone for 2026</b><br><br>
The opening round delivered an unmistakable message — attacking rugby will define the season. Across four matches, teams combined for a remarkable number of tries, momentum swings and historic moments, including the introduction of powerplay scoring. With defending champions beaten, newcomers tested and several contenders making bold early statements, the season has begun in explosive fashion — and the intensity is only expected to rise in the rounds ahead.<br><br>

South Africa delivered a comprehensive performance to defeat New Zealand by 7 wickets in their Group D clash of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026 at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
New Zealand, batting first, posted a competitive 175/7 in their 20 overs, led by Mark Chapman's 48, Finn Allen's 31, and Daryl Mitchell's 32. However, South Africa's pace attack proved decisive, with Marco Jansen claiming 4 wickets for 40 runs, applying consistent pressure and breaking key partnerships throughout the innings.<br><br>
Chasing 176, South Africa looked in control from the outset. Aiden Markram anchored the innings with an unbeaten 86 off 44 balls, striking eight fours and four sixes. Contributions from Quinton de Kock (20), Ryan Rickelton (21), Dewald Brevis (21), and David Miller (24 not out) helped the Proteas reach 178/3 in 17.1 overs, sealing victory with 17 balls to spare.<br><br>
The win keeps South Africa unbeaten in Group D and puts them in a strong position to advance to the Super 8s stage. For New Zealand, the loss is their first of the tournament, making their final group match crucial.<br><br>

    <h2>MAMELODI SUNDOWNS RETURN TO CAF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE LAST 8, READY TO FACE PIRATES</h2>

Mamelodi Sundowns have booked their place in the CAF Champions League quarter‑finals after a vital 2‑0 victory over MC Alger at Loftus Versfeld Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The result secures the South African champions' progression from Group C, finishing second on nine points behind Al‑Hilal, who topped the pool.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Colombian forward Brayan Leon was the architect of Sundowns' success, grabbing a brace with a goal in each half to fire Masandawana into the continental last eight. His first came inside six minutes as he reacted quickest to a rebound in the box, and he doubled the lead just past the hour mark from close range after a well‑worked move.<br><br>
Sundowns now continue their impressive run in Africa's premier club competition, maintaining their reputation as one of the continent's most consistent sides by reaching the quarter‑finals once again.<br><br>
With continental qualification confirmed, Sundowns' focus immediately shifts back to domestic action. They will host Orlando Pirates on 18 February in a crucial Betway Premiership clash as both sides look to build momentum ahead of the knockout stages.<br><br>
The victory over MC Alger was a spirited performance from Sundowns, combining defensive discipline with clinical finishing when it mattered most. As they set their sights on the quarter‑final draw and upcoming challenges, Masandawana will aim to carry this form into both their CAF and PSL campaigns.<br><br>

Orlando Pirates produced a commanding display to defeat Marumo Gallants 3–0 in their Betway Premiership clash at Orlando Stadium on Saturday, delivering a dominant performance in front of their home supporters on Valentine's Day.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
<b>Fast start puts hosts in control</b><br><br>
Pirates wasted little time asserting themselves and took the lead early in the contest when Yanela Mbuthuma found the breakthrough, finishing confidently after sustained attacking pressure.<br><br>
The home side continued to control possession and dictate the tempo, pinning Gallants deep inside their own half for long spells. Their dominance was rewarded again before the interval, with Patrick Maswanganyi doubling the advantage to give the hosts a comfortable cushion at halftime.<br><br>
<b>Pirates seal emphatic win</b><br><br>
Gallants attempted to respond after the break but struggled to break down a well-organised Pirates defence, while the hosts remained threatening going forward.<br><br>
The result was put beyond doubt late in the match when Relebohile Mofokeng added a third, calmly finishing to cap a polished team performance and seal an emphatic victory.<br><br>
<b>Momentum continues</b><br><br>
The win extends Pirates' strong run of form and strengthens their push near the top of the league standings. With three goals, a clean sheet, and control throughout the contest, the Buccaneers delivered both entertainment and efficiency on home soil.<br><br>
On a festive matchday filled with celebration in the stands, Pirates ensured the occasion ended with maximum points — and a statement performance.<br><br>

The 2026 season of the FNB Varsity Shield began in explosive fashion, with dominant victories, a major upset, and a thrilling comeback draw setting the tone for an exciting campaign ahead.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Opening round action saw emphatic wins for FNB UKZN Impi, FNB UWC and FNB CPUT, while FNB WSU and FNB Wits played out a dramatic draw. UKZN emerged as early pace-setters after a commanding performance in Durban.<br><br>
<b>UKZN make powerful early statement</b><br><br>
UKZN surged to the top of the standings with a dominant 46–15 victory over FNB SPU, running in eight tries in an impressive display of attacking precision and forward dominance.<br><br>
From the outset, the Durban side imposed their physicality and tempo, controlling territory and capitalising on scoring opportunities with clinical efficiency. Despite a spirited effort from SPU, UKZN's cohesion and finishing ensured the result was never in doubt.<br><br>
The performance positions them as early favourites and sends a clear message to the rest of the competition.<br><br>
<b>UWC deliver clinical victory over UFH</b><br><br>
UWC opened their campaign in style with a convincing 38–12 win against FNB UFH.<br><br>
The visitors combined structured attacking play with sharp finishing to build a commanding halftime lead. UFH showed improved intensity after the break and managed to cross the line, but UWC's control, discipline, and attacking rhythm proved decisive.<br><br>
A standout individual display helped drive the victory, underlining UWC's potential as serious contenders this season.<br><br>
<b>CPUT stun Madibaz in comeback performance</b><br><br>
One of the biggest surprises of the opening round came in Bellville, where CPUT produced a determined comeback to defeat FNB Madibaz 30–20.<br><br>
Madibaz started strongly and built an early lead, but momentum shifted before halftime as CPUT struck back with decisive attacking phases. The hosts controlled the second half through strong forward play and effective game management, securing a composed victory against last season's runners-up.<br><br>
The result could prove significant in shaping early momentum in the competition.<br><br>
<b>WSU and Wits share spoils in thrilling draw</b><br><br>
The most dramatic match of the round unfolded in Mdantsane, where WSU and Wits battled to a gripping 27–27 draw.<br><br>
WSU dominated the first half and surged into a commanding lead, but Wits mounted an impressive second-half comeback, scoring multiple tries to level the contest. The high-tempo encounter showcased attacking intent and resilience from both sides, with neither able to find a decisive breakthrough.<br><br>
The draw reflected a fiercely competitive contest and provided one of the standout spectacles of the opening weekend.<br><br>
<b>Strong start sets tone for the season</b><br><br>
Round one delivered intensity, attacking flair, and momentum swings across the board, offering an early glimpse of what promises to be a fiercely contested season.<br><br>
UKZN's emphatic victory places them at the top of the standings, but strong performances from UWC and CPUT, along with the competitiveness shown by WSU and Wits, suggest the race for Varsity Shield honours remains wide open.<br><br>
If the opening round is anything to go by, the 2026 campaign is set to deliver drama, excitement, and high-quality university rugby in the weeks ahead.<br><br>

Buoyed by home advantage, Chippa will look to continue their winning momentum.<br><br>

The South African Proteas survived one of the most extraordinary finishes in T20 World Cup history, beating Afghanistan after not one, but two Super Overs — a first in the tournament.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
At the Narendra Modi Stadium, fans witnessed drama, near-misses, last-ball heroics and towering sixes in a match that felt like three games rolled into one.<br><br>
<b>Regulation Time: Edge-of-Your-Seat Cricket</b><br><br>
Sent in to bat, South Africa posted 187/6, anchored by fluent Quinton de Kock (59) and blistering Ryan Rickelton (61), who shared a 114-run partnership that looked set to give the Proteas a solid platform.<br><br>
Afghanistan refused to bow out. Rahmanullah Gurbaz smashed 84 off 42 balls, including seven huge sixes, keeping his side in striking distance. With just one wicket left and 13 runs required off the final over, costly no-balls from Kagiso Rabada and a sensational run-out off a free hit tied the match at 187, forcing a Super Over.<br><br>
<b>Super Over 1: Tension at Fever Pitch</b><br><br>
Afghanistan posted 17 runs in the first Super Over. South Africa kept pace, and Tristan Stubbs hit a last-ball six to level it again — sending the match into a historic second Super Over.<br><br>
<b>Super Over 2: Drama Decides the Winner</b><br><br>
In the deciding mini-match, South Africa set a challenging 23 runs, with Stubbs and David Miller delivering big hits. Afghanistan's chase started brightly, with Gurbaz smashing three consecutive sixes, but the Proteas held firm. A misfield on the final ball handed South Africa a nerve-jangling four-run victory.<br><br>
<b>Aftermath: Ecstasy and Agony</b><br><br>
Afghanistan coach Jonathan Trott called the loss "devastating," while South Africa celebrated a morale-boosting win that keeps their Super 8 hopes alive.<br><br>
<b>Match at a Glance</b><br><br>
South Africa: 187/6 (20 overs)<br><br>
Afghanistan: 187 (19.4 overs)<br><br>
Super Over 1: Tie (SA 17/1, AFG 17/0)<br><br>
Super Over 2: SA 23/0, AFG 19/2 — South Africa win by 4 runs<br><br>
This match was a reminder of T20 cricket's unpredictability — thrilling, unforgiving, and utterly captivating.<br><br>

    <p>The Nedbank Cup has taken another step toward its decisive stages after the Premier Soccer League confirmed the Round of 16 fixtures following Wednesday evening's draw.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
With defending champions Kaizer Chiefs already eliminated from the competition, this season's tournament will produce a new name on the trophy. Amakhosi's exit at the hands of Stellenbosch FC has shifted the spotlight onto the remaining contenders, as both top-flight heavyweights and lower-division hopefuls prepare for the next chapter.<br><br>
The PSL has indicated that match dates and venues will be announced in due course.<br><br>
<b>🔹 Round of 16 Fixtures</b><br><br>
• Milford FC vs Mkhambathi FC<br><br>
• Golden Arrows vs Stellenbosch FC<br><br>
• University of Pretoria vs Sekhukhune United<br><br>
• Jacksa Spears vs CR Vasco da Gama<br><br>
• TS Galaxy vs Mamelodi Sundowns<br><br>
• Upington City vs Durban City FC<br><br>
• Richards Bay FC vs AmaZulu FC<br><br>
• Orlando Pirates vs Casric Stars<br><br>
The Last 32 concluded on Tuesday evening, with AmaZulu advancing after defeating Polokwane City, while Milford FC also secured their place in the next round.<br><br>
Among the standout fixtures, TS Galaxy's meeting with Mamelodi Sundowns promises to draw significant attention, while Orlando Pirates will be wary of a potential upset when they face Casric Stars. Stellenbosch FC, buoyed by their victory over Chiefs, now turn their focus to Golden Arrows in what could prove another testing encounter.<br><br>
With the competition narrowing and the quarter-finals within reach, the intensity is expected to rise as clubs look to keep their Nedbank Cup ambitions alive.<br><br>

South Africa got their T20 World Cup 2026 campaign off to a flying start, posting 213‑4 against Canada in their Group D opener at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. Skipper Aiden Markram led from the front with a composed half-century, anchoring a total that puts the Proteas firmly in control.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Markram's innings combined steady shot-making with timely aggression, helping South Africa navigate the middle overs after a fast start from openers Quinton de Kock and Ryan Rickelton. Contributions from David Miller and Tristan Stubbs accelerated the scoring in the final overs, ensuring the team crossed the 200-run mark — a competitive benchmark in T20 cricket.
<br><br>
For Canada, the bowlers showed grit but struggled to contain a full-strength South African lineup on a flat pitch that favored strokeplay. The visitors now face the challenge of chasing a daunting total under pressure.

The SPAR Proteas, South Africa's national women's netball team, secured their fifth Africa Netball Cup title on Sunday, defeating Uganda 56–34 in the final at the Griffins Saenda Sports Complex in Lilongwe, Malawi.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Led by head coach Jenny van Dyk, the Proteas dominated the match from the start, maintaining control through all four quarters. Their disciplined performance ensured that Uganda never gained the upper hand, resulting in a comfortable victory for South Africa.
<br><br>
"This win is a testament to our team's focus and hard work," said Van Dyk. "We prepared for every quarter, knowing Uganda would challenge us, and the players executed the plan perfectly."

<br><br>
In the men's division, South Africa's national team also retained the title, defeating Zimbabwe 40–29, highlighting the country's continued dominance in African netball.

Orlando Pirates continued their strong run in this season's Nedbank Cup with an emphatic 4-1 victory over third-tier side Tshakhuma Tsha Madzivhandila (TTM) on Saturday afternoon.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The Soweto giants, who sit among the Betway Premiership frontrunners and are regarded as strong contenders for silverware this season, asserted their dominance early and booked their place in the Round of 16 with a clinical performance.
<br><br>
<b>Pirates Take Command Early</b>
<br><br>
Orlando Pirates controlled possession from the opening whistle and broke the deadlock in the 10th minute after being awarded a penalty. Oswin Appollis was fouled inside the box, allowing Andre de Jong to step up and calmly convert from the spot to give the Buccaneers an early lead.
<br><br>
<b>Second Goal and Tshakhuma Response</b>
<br><br>
Pirates doubled their advantage in the 17th minute when Thalente Mbatha fired a long-range effort that took a slight deflection on its way into the net, putting the favourites firmly in control.
<br><br>
Tshakhuma showed resilience and pulled one back in the 38th minute through Sithembiso Ngobe, who curled a superb free-kick past the goalkeeper to reduce the deficit before halftime.
<br><br>
<b>Second-Half Control and Final Flourish</b>
<br><br>
The Buccaneers reasserted themselves early in the second half, with Patrick Maswanganyi restoring the two-goal cushion in the 51st minute after a well-worked team move.
<br><br>
Pirates managed the remainder of the match comfortably, limiting Tshakhuma's attacking threat and dictating the tempo. The victory was sealed in stoppage time when Sipho Mbule marked his return with a powerful strike from outside the box to make it 4-1.
<br><br>
<b>What It Means</b>

The FNB Varsity Cup has confirmed SportPesa as its newest national sponsor, a partnership that strengthens the tournament's role as a key development pathway for South African rugby talent.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The collaboration marks another step in SportPesa's growing involvement in local sport, following the betting company's multi-year partnership with Varsity Football men's and women's competitions, which began in January 2025. Their expansion into varsity rugby highlights a shared commitment to nurturing young athletes while supporting the balance between academic life and high-performance sport.
<br><br>
Lisa Roux, Sponsorship Manager at Advent Sport Entertainment and Media (ASEM), the agency managing the Varsity Cup, welcomed the partnership and highlighted the strong alignment between the two organisations.
<br><br>
"Partnering with SportPesa is an incredibly exciting step for the FNB Varsity Cup," Roux said. "Their passion for developing talent mirrors our vision for the tournament. Beyond high-performance rugby, they place real value on community upliftment and long-term athlete development, which makes this collaboration especially meaningful."
<br><br>
SportPesa has already established a presence in South African rugby through its partnership with the DHL Stormers. According to the brand, supporting the next generation of players was a natural progression and an opportunity to invest further in structured development systems.
<br><br>
SportPesa South Africa Managing Director Dean Delaney expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, noting the positive impact of previous collaborations with Varsity Sports.
<br><br>
"We're incredibly excited to deepen our involvement in South African rugby through the FNB Varsity Cup," Delaney said. "Our recent work with Varsity Sports has shown us the value of authentic engagement in building trust with institutions, teams and supporters."
<br><br>
Delaney added that SportPesa's broader objective is to contribute meaningfully to local and community-based sport.
<br><br>
"By investing responsibly in organised competitions and development pathways, we believe we can play a role in growing rugby in South Africa and supporting the journey of future stars," he said.
<br><br>
The partnership is expected to further enhance the Varsity Cup platform, creating expanded opportunities for both men's and women's student-athletes across the country.

    <h2>UFS Clinch Historic Varsity Football Title in Nerve-Wracking Penalty Shootout</h2>

The University of the Free State (UFS) etched their name into Varsity Football history on Thursday night, claiming their first-ever title after a dramatic 5-4 penalty shootout win over defending champions Tshwane University of Technology (TUT) at Shimla Park.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
A tightly contested final finished goalless after 90 intense minutes, sending the decider to penalties for a third consecutive year. With the scores level after four kicks each, TUT’s Lehlomo Tolo fired his effort over the crossbar – the only miss of the shootout – opening the door for UFS to seal a famous victory.
<br><br>
Substitute Theko Phinithi, who had replaced injured captain Iviwe Dyabuza in the first half, stepped up with nerves of steel to bury the final spot-kick and spark scenes of jubilation among the home supporters.
Fierce Battle in the City of Roses
The match kicked off at a blistering pace, with both teams clearly fired up for the occasion. UFS, making only their second appearance in a Varsity Football final, nearly took the lead early on through the lively Jerome Jansen, whose low drive whistled just past the post.
The turning point of the first half came in the 25th minute when UFS skipper Dyabuza and TUT’s midfield dynamo Lucky Raphala were forced off after a heavy collision. The double blow disrupted both teams’ rhythm but didn’t dampen the intensity.
<br><br>
Despite end-to-end action and a determined attacking display from the Kovsies in the second half, the deadlock could not be broken. TUT's backline, marshalled by captain Alan Moja, remained resolute under sustained pressure.
Penalty Drama Decides It
With the final deadlocked at 0-0, the contest headed to a shootout under the floodlights. Both teams converted their first two penalties with precision. The decisive moment came with TUT’s third attempt when Tolo ballooned his effort over the bar.
Though there was a brief moment of confusion among the home crowd – mistakenly celebrating a perceived miss by Kediwe Ncenya – UFS maintained their composure. Phinithi, showing remarkable calmness, slotted the final kick to seal a 5-4 triumph and UFS's maiden Varsity Football crown.
<br><br>
Individual Accolades Despite the defeat, TUT’s Surprise Khoza was named FNB Player of the Match for his relentless performance in midfield. The tournament’s top individual awards went elsewhere: NWU’s Ethan Mokwena earned the Cashbuild Golden Glove, while his teammate Aphelele Sibisi took home the FNB Player of the Tournament. The Suzuki Golden Boot was awarded to Keletso Sekhwela of UJ.

FIFA has sanctioned South Africa by deducting three points in their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign. 

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The punishment follows a ruling that midfielder Teboho Mokoena was fielded while suspended in a match against Lesotho. The original 2–0 win was overturned, and Lesotho were awarded a 3–0 victory. In addition, South Africa has been fined 10,000 Swiss francs.

Orlando Pirates secured their fourth straight MTN8 title with a 3-0 extra-time victory over Stellenbosch FC at Mbombela Stadium on 13 September 2025.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
The win marks a historic achievement, as the Buccaneers became the first club in the competition’s history to lift the trophy four times in a row.
<br><br>
After a tense 90 minutes without goals, Pirates dominated extra time. Tshepang Moremi broke the deadlock in the 92nd minute and later added another in the 110th. Tshegofatso Mabasa scored in between with a well-placed finish in the 103rd minute, sealing the result for the Soweto giants. The victory brings Orlando Pirates’ total MTN8 titles to 14, underlining their dominance in South African football. It was also the first major trophy under new head coach Abdeslam Ouaddou, who praised the team’s resilience and tactical discipline after the match.<br>
Stellenbosch, who reached the final for a second consecutive year, once again fell short against a clinical Pirates side. Despite their efforts, they were outclassed in extra time by a team with greater big-match experience.

    <h2>South Africa Ends 16‑Year Wait: Bafana Bafana Clinch 2026 World Cup Slot</h2>

    <p>
South Africa’s national football team, Bafana Bafana, has officially qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, marking their return to the global stage for the first time since 2010.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 The qualification ends a 16‑year absence from the tournament when they were automatic participants as hosts. 
<br><br>
Decisive Moment: Mbombela Seals the Deal The qualification was secured on 14 October 2025 at Mbombela Stadium, where South Africa defeated Rwanda 3‑0. Thalente Mbatha opened the scoring early, Oswin Appollis doubled the lead before halftime, and Evidence Makgopa capped the win with a second‑half goal. 
That victory allowed South Africa to finish top of Group C with 18 points, narrowly edging out Nigeria and Benin. Nigeria also won their final match 4‑0 against Benin, but South Africa’s superior goal margin and results carried them through. 
<br><br>
Challenges Along the Journey Points Deduction South Africa’s campaign was not without controversy. Earlier in the qualifiers, they fielded a suspended player, Teboho Mokoena, in a match against Lesotho. Because of this, FIFA penalised them by overturning a 2‑0 win and awarding Lesotho a 3‑0 win by forfeit. The ruling cost South Africa three points, which tightened the race in Group C.<br>
Unexpected Slip in the Home Stretch Before the decisive matchday, South Africa had built a solid lead. At one point they led Group C by five points with four matches to go. But draws at home—against Nigeria and Zimbabwe—combined with the points deduction, saw them fall behind Benin on goal difference before the final round. 
<br><br>
Historical Significance This will be South Africa’s fourth appearance at a FIFA World Cup finals: previously in 1998, 2002, and as hosts in 2010. It is the first time they have qualified on merit (i.e. through the qualifiers) since 2002. 
<br><br>
Reflections and What’s Next Coach Hugo Broos was quick to acknowledge the collective effort from the players, staff, and management. In his comments following the Rwanda match, he praised the discipline and consistency shown throughout the campaign. 
<br><br>
Looking forward, the 2026 World Cup expands to 48 teams, which gives nations like South Africa renewed hope and more room for opportunity. The team now aims to build on this qualification, preparing for the demands of the tournament alongside other high level competitions such as the Africa Cup of Nations. Confédération Africaine de Football +1<br>
Bafana Bafana’s qualification is more than just a return—it’s a statement. After years of ups and downs, administrative missteps, and narrow escapes, the national side has shown resilience. Next year, South Africa will represent Africa at the global stage, carrying both expectation and possibility.<br> (Image By: 📷Dirk Kotze/ Gallo Image)

The stage is set for a blockbuster semi-final round in the 2025 Varsity Women’s Football tournament after a decisive Round 3 concluded at UJ Soweto Stadium.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Reigning champions University of the Western Cape (UWC) continued their title defence in dominant fashion, while University of Johannesburg (UJ), Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), and University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) completed the semi-final line-up. Here’s how the action unfolded:
<br><br>
<b>UWC Marches On with Third Consecutive Win </b> 
<br><br>
UWC confirmed their place in the semi-finals with a clinical 2-0 victory over UP-Tuks. The defending champions showed their class early, as Chelsea Daniels headed home from a corner by Mmabatho Mogale in just the 7th minute. Despite some resistance from UP-Tuks, UWC maintained control throughout.<br><br>
Mogale, who was later named Player of the Match, doubled the lead in the 39th minute with a stunning goal directly from a corner — a rare feat that sealed the result and a perfect group stage campaign for UWC.
<br>
<i>Final Score: (UWC 2-0 UP-Tuks)</i><br>

<b>
Wits Take Narrow Win Over Gritty CPUT </b> 
<br><br>
Wits made a winning start to their 2025 campaign with a gritty 1-0 win over CPUT in windy and physical conditions. The decisive moment came early, as Ayanda Mnyembane found the back of the net in the third minute following a clever through ball.<br><br>
Despite CPUT's attempts to equalise, including a powerful strike from Sinelisiwe Phumlomo in the 20th minute that forced a superb save from Wits goalkeeper Bridgette Moekwa, they couldn’t find a breakthrough. The match remained tense and competitive throughout, but Wits’ early goal and solid defensive shape ensured they left with maximum points.

UJ Crushes CPUT to Top Group B
</b> 
<br><br>
UJ Women’s Football produced a commanding display in their 4-0 rout of CPUT, finishing the group stage unbeaten and atop Group B. Star striker Adivhaho Mphangale led from the front, scoring twice once from a header and once with a powerful strike just outside the box.<br><br>
Further goals from Thato Mofolo and substitute Malitsatsi Mosala — who converted a late penalty — ensured a convincing victory for the Orange Army. Midfielder Sthembile Msomi earned the Player of the Match award for her influential performance.
<br>
<i>Final Score: (UJ 4 - 0 CPUT)
</i><br>
<i>Goal Scorers: UJ-Adivhaho Mphangale (2), Thato Mofolo, Malitsatsi Mosala

TUT Turns on the Style in 8-0 Masterclass
After a slow start to the tournament, TUT Women’s Football exploded into life with an 8-0 demolition of UNIVEN.
<br><br>
Thabiso Senyatsi and Naledi Thakanyane both netted hat-tricks, with TUT finding their rhythm at just the right time. Mokgaetji Ramanna and Lindiwe Nkambule added their names to the scoresheet as well, capping off a dominant team performance. Senyatsi’s hat-trick and all-round display earned her the FNB Player of the Match accolade.

NWU and Wits Share the Spoils in Drama-Filled Draw

    <h2>Thabiso Monyane Replaces Injured Nyiko Mobbie in Bafana Bafana Squad Ahead of Crucial Nigeria Clash</h2>

    <p>
Bafana Bafana head coach Hugo Broos has made a late change to his squad for the ongoing 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, calling up defender Thabiso Monyane to replace the injured Nyiko Mobbie.


      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Mobbie was forced off the field within the first five minutes of South Africa’s dominant 3-0 victory over Lesotho on Friday night at the Free State Stadium. The national team’s medical staff later confirmed the severity of his injury.
<br><br>
According to Bafana Bafana team doctor Tshepo Molobi, Mobbie sustained a triple fracture to the eye socket following a clash of heads early in the first half. He was immediately taken to hospital and underwent surgery on Saturday morning. "The injury happened as a result of a clash of heads in the first half and he sustained a fracture of the eye socket in three places," said Dr Molobi. "Further updates on his recovery will be provided after post-surgery evaluations."
<br><br>
In response, Broos has called up Thabiso Monyane, who will report to the national team camp in Bloemfontein this weekend as preparations continue for the high-stakes encounter against Nigeria on Tuesday night, also at the Free State Stadium.
<br><br>
There was also concern for Thabo Moloisane, who had to leave the field in the 52nd minute against Lesotho due to an injury. However, Dr Molobi provided a positive update, confirming that Moloisane is recovering well and is expected to return to training by Saturday afternoon.
<br><br>
South Africa's convincing win over Lesotho keeps them firmly at the top of Group C, maintaining a five-point lead after five matches. Benin's 1-0 victory over Zimbabwe on the same day propelled them into second place with 11 points.

The Varsity Women’s Football 2025 tournament got underway at UJ Soweto Stadium with an action-packed Round 1.
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Defending champions UWC battled past TUT in a tightly contested clash, UP-Tuks were ruthless against debutants UNIVEN, UJ delivered a commanding performance at home, and Wits edged a determined CPUT side. The opening round served up goals, standout performances, and early signs of who could emerge as contenders this season.<br><br>
<b>UWC Edges TUT in a Tense Opener </b> 
<br><br>
Defending champions UWC opened their campaign with a hard-earned 2-1 victory over TUT in a game that tested both sides’ resolve. UWC struck first through Zikhona Nogqala in the 22nd minute after a dominant start in possession. But their lead was short-lived, as TUT responded just two minutes later with a well-taken equaliser from Thabiso Senyatsi.<br><br>
The second half saw TUT pile on the pressure, dictating the pace and creating multiple chances. However, UWC’s defensive structure remained intact. The breakthrough came late in the game when Chelsea Daniels fired in a stunning long-range goal from the D-line to secure all three points for the Cape side.
<br>
<i>Final Score: (UWC 2-1 TUT)</i><br>
<i>Goal Scorers: UWC- Zikhona Nogqala, Chelsea Daniels, TUT- Thabiso Senyatsi</i><br>

<b>
Wits Take Narrow Win Over Gritty CPUT </b> 
<br><br>
Wits made a winning start to their 2025 campaign with a gritty 1-0 win over CPUT in windy and physical conditions. The decisive moment came early, as Ayanda Mnyembane found the back of the net in the third minute following a clever through ball.<br><br>
Despite CPUT's attempts to equalise, including a powerful strike from Sinelisiwe Phumlomo in the 20th minute that forced a superb save from Wits goalkeeper Bridgette Moekwa, they couldn’t find a breakthrough. The match remained tense and competitive throughout, but Wits’ early goal and solid defensive shape ensured they left with maximum points.

UP-Tuks Thrash UNIVEN in Dominant Display
</b> 
<br><br>
It was a baptism of fire for newcomers UNIVEN, who took a surprise lead against UP-Tuks through Andani Dabana in the 14th minute. The joy was short-lived, though, as Tuks quickly regained control and launched a relentless offensive.<br><br>
Nonhlakanipho Lucy Filand equalised just past the half-hour mark, and Sbahle Ndlovu added a quick second to give Tuks a 2-1 lead at the break. Ndlovu completed her brace early in the second half, Moeletsi Digoro extended the lead with a sharp finish, and substitute Rethabile Makhwela capped off the performance with a powerful header from a corner.

<br><br>
UJ put in the most dominant performance of Round 1, sweeping aside NWU with a 4-0 win in front of their home crowd. The Orange Army got off to a flying start when Sbongakonke Mzobe opened the scoring in the 7th minute with a composed finish.
<br><br>
From there, it was the Thato Mofolo show. The forward netted a brilliant hat-trick, finishing chances with clinical precision and putting the result beyond doubt. Coach Nthabeleng Modiko used the second half to rotate the squad, showing confidence in her depth as the tournament progresses.

     The Varsity Netball 2025 tournament delivered another round of high-octane performances, with the University of Johannesburg (UJ) ascending to the summit of the log following a commanding win over Varsity College.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Meanwhile, the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) pulled off an impressive upset against Madibaz, handing the latter their first defeat of the tournament.
<br><br>
UJ set the pace early against Varsity College, demonstrating sharp speed and precise passing to open up a lead, ending the first quarter at 14-8. Though Varsity College tightened their defence in the second quarter, UJ maintained composure to extend their halftime lead to 24-15. After the break, fresh legs from Varsity College sparked a brief resurgence, but UJ’s relentless pace and clinical finishing saw them pull away decisively, closing the match 56-34. Cornelia Mupenda was named player of the match for her consistent and commanding performance.
<br><br>
In another key fixture, NWU edged out Maties in a tightly contested encounter. The Eagles started strong with a 13-9 lead in the first quarter but saw momentum shift as Maties fought back in the second. Nevertheless, NWU regained their composure in the third quarter, building a substantial lead which they defended staunchly in the final quarter to secure a 55-41 victory. Vivian Venancio’s stellar play earned her player of the match honours.
<br><br>
Meanwhile, defending champions UFS Kovsies showcased their dominance in a comprehensive 73-37 thrashing of UP-Tuks. The Kovsies leveraged an aggressive defensive strategy to disrupt Tuks’ rhythm, establishing a comfortable lead early on. Liame de Lange anchored the defence and was named player of the match as Kovsies maintained their pace and precision throughout, reaffirming their status as tournament favourites.
<br><br>
The most dramatic showdown came when Wits stunned previously unbeaten Madibaz, inflicting their first loss of the season with a 63-50 victory. Wits led from start to finish, steadily increasing their advantage each quarter. Amber Marshall’s effortless scoring and tactical poise earned her player of the match, while Madibaz’s Hanniska van Vuuren and Kaylin Coetzer fought valiantly to keep their side in the contest. Despite a late surge by Madibaz in the third quarter, Wits maintained control and composure, sealing a well-deserved victory.

     In a tightly contested encounter, the Orange Army secured a narrow 1-0 victory over Wits, thanks to a decisive penalty converted by Tumelo Machete.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
This crucial goal handed the Orange Army the bragging rights as the kings of Joburg in this tournament.
Wits suffered their first loss of the competition, while the University of Johannesburg (UJ) recorded their second win from three matches, further strengthening their position in the tournament standings.<br><br>
A standout performer for UJ was Sinenhlanhla Mkhonza, who once again showcased his quality on the field and earned his consecutive FNB Player of the Match award. His consistent impact has been instrumental in UJ’s positive run in the tournament.

Round 2 of the 2025 Varsity Football campaign delivered all the thrills fans could hope for 
 <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
with Wits, UJ, and NWU each collecting important victories to strengthen their early season positions. Meanwhile, the much-anticipated Tshwane derby between UP-Tuks and TUT ended in a dramatic goalless stalemate.<br><br>
<b>Wits Outclass DUT at Home</b> <br><br>
Wits continued their strong start to the season with a confident 2-0 win over Durban University of Technology (DUT) at a buzzing Wits Stadium. Following their emphatic 4-1 victory against CUT in the opening round, the Cleverboys showed their intent early on and dominated possession.
Prince Manku opened the scoring with a long-range stunner in first-half stoppage time, after a clever assist by Tebogo Masemola. DUT responded with greater intensity in the second half, but Wits’ defense, anchored by goalkeeper Lwando Mvinjana, held firm. Masemola later turned scorer to seal the win, finishing off a rare assist from his own goalkeeper. Player of the Match, Kgwadi Molepo, was instrumental in Wits’ control of the midfield.<br>
<i>Final Score: Wits 2–0 DUT</i><br>
<i>Scorers: Prince Manku, Tebogo Masemola</i><br>

<b>Sibisi Leads NWU to Victory</b> <br><br>
NWU edged CUT 1-0 in a hard-fought clash, thanks to a captain’s goal from Aphelele Sibisi in the 57th minute. After a goalless first half where NWU dominated but failed to convert their chances, the breakthrough came via a well-timed header from Sibisi following a precise cross from the right.
NWU managed the rest of the game with maturity, controlling possession and shutting down CUT's efforts to equalize. Momelezi Mngati was named Player of the Match for his outstanding contribution in midfield.<br>

<b>Late Drama as UJ Snatch Win Over UFS </b> <br><br>
In Bloemfontein, UJ left it late to steal a 1-0 win over the University of the Free State (UFS). With the game seemingly heading for a draw, striker Keletso Sekhwela rose highest in the 93rd minute to nod in a match-winning goal from a corner kick.
UFS had moments of promise, especially through winger Samkelo Nakedi, but couldn’t break down a resilient UJ side. UJ’s Sinenhlanhla Mkhonza delivered a standout performance in midfield and was deservedly named Player of the Match.<br>
<i>Final Score: UFS 0–1 UJ</i><br>
<i>Scorer: Keletso Sekhwela</i><br>

<b>Tshwane Derby Ends in Goalless Draw </b> <br><br>
One of the biggest fixtures of the round saw city rivals UP-Tuks and TUT share the spoils in a tense 0-0 draw at Tuks Stadium. Both sides created chances, but failed to convert, with goalkeepers and defensive units standing tall throughout.
Tuks’ star striker Samukelo Ngodela and TUT’s Menzukuthula Ntshangase both missed golden opportunities, while a late goal by substitute Mathuane Selotola was ruled offside, denying Tuks a dramatic winner. Defender Edward Rankwe of UP-Tuks earned Player of the Match honors for his composure at the back.<br>

<b>Wits Mark Their Return with Dominant Win</b> <br><br>
Returning to the competition after a two-year absence, Wits University delivered a commanding performance at Wits Rugby Stadium, defeating Central University of Technology (CUT) 4-1.
Tebogo Masemola opened the scoring after a smart assist from Simphiwe Mabena, while a red card to CUT’s Malefetsane Doctor Matale before halftime left the visitors at a disadvantage. Wits capitalized in the second half, adding goals from Sfiso Mlondo, Mxolisi Mthiya, and Mabena. CUT’s Nkosingiphile Lubisi managed a late consolation, but Wits had already sealed a convincing victory.<br>

TUT edged a determined DUT side 1-0 at the Harry Gwala Stadium in Pietermaritzburg, denying the newcomers a dream debut.
Precious Mohale gave TUT the lead in the seventh minute, and although DUT pushed hard — including a missed penalty brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Sekwanele Mtolo — they couldn’t find a way back. TUT’s defensive resilience and game management saw them secure all three points.<br>

<b>Late Equalizer Earns NWU Draw Against UJ</b><br><br>
At UJ Stadium, hosts University of Johannesburg (UJ) were held to a 1-1 draw by North-West University (NWU) in a high-energy encounter.
UJ struck early, with Thabo Moshikere scoring in the third minute after a clever assist from Yasidu Lifa. Despite holding the lead for much of the match, UJ couldn’t close it out. Molemo Kukama found the equalizer in the 89th minute for NWU, snatching a point in the dying moments.<br>

     Chippa United head coach Sinethemba Badela has set out a clear vision for the 2025/26 DStv Premiership season — to win matches while playing a brand of football that excites fans.

      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
 Speaking ahead of the campaign, Badela made it clear that his ambitions for the team go beyond simply surviving in the top flight. He wants the Chilli Boys to be competitive, entertaining, and progressive in their approach.<br><br>
“We are looking to try and win as many matches as we can,” said Badela. “We are also looking forward to being an exciting team to watch.”
Now heading into his second full season in charge, the 34-year-old coach is overseeing a period of growth and transformation at the club. Chippa United have brought in new signings over the off-season and have placed a strong focus on tactical development, youth integration, and consistent performances.
“Chippa United are a growing team,” Badela continued. “We want to play attractive football — not just for entertainment, but because it’s part of our identity and it can bring long-term results.”<br><br>
Badela is part of a new generation of South African coaches bringing fresh ideas to the game. His philosophy emphasizes structure, intelligent pressing, and ball movement — a clear shift from the club’s historically pragmatic style. Those within the club say he has already had a positive influence on the players' mindset and the overall team culture.
The technical team has worked hard in pre-season to prepare for what is expected to be a highly competitive league campaign. New players have been recruited not only for their experience but also for their ability to fit into a dynamic system aimed at controlling games and creating chances.<br><br>
Chippa United will face early tests against some of the Premiership’s stronger sides, but the mood in the camp is one of quiet confidence. With a clearly defined identity and a coach who believes in building something sustainable, the club hopes to turn heads for the right reasons this season.
For Chippa United, 2025/26 may not just be about survival — it may be the beginning of a new era defined by ambition, identity, and entertaining football.<br> (Image By: 📷Backpagepix)

     Former AmaZulu academy player Langelihle Phili scores dramatic winner to send Stellies into semi-finals.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
AmaZulu FC’s MTN8 campaign came to a heartbreaking end as they were beaten 3–2 after extra time by Stellenbosch FC at the DHL Stadium.
Keagan Allen gave AmaZulu an early lead, capitalising on a defensive scramble to open the scoring. But Stellenbosch responded through a brace from Sanele Barns—his second a brilliant free kick—to put the home side ahead.<br><br>
Tebogo Mashigo levelled the tie again in the 73rd minute, forcing extra time in a thrilling encounter.
The decisive blow came in the 108th minute when former AmaZulu academy product Langelihle Phili curled in a stunning winner against his old club.
After the match, AmaZulu coach Arthur Zwane admitted his side lost focus when it mattered most.<br><br>
“We took the foot off the pedal,” said Zwane. “You can’t afford that in knockout football.”

     Orlando Pirates captain Nkosinathi Sibisi says his team is focused and ready to defend their MTN8 title as they prepare to face Polokwane City in a tough quarter-final showdown.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
Sibisi, who recently took over the captaincy from Innocent Maela, is embracing the challenge and believes the Buccaneers are prepared for battle.
“We want to defend what’s ours,” he told the SABC. “It won’t be easy — we know how tough Polokwane City can be — but we’re confident, especially at home.”
Pirates edged Polokwane City 1-0 in their most recent encounter last season, with Sibisi himself scoring the winner. That result adds to their confidence going into the weekend, but the captain isn’t taking anything for granted.<br><br>
Meanwhile, Polokwane City defender Tlou Nkwe is well aware of the challenge his side faces but insists they are ready.
“It’s never easy playing the defending champions away,” said Nkwe. “But we’ve prepared well, and we’re ready to step up.”
Both teams are eager to kick off their 2025/26 campaigns with a strong showing, and the MTN8 quarter-final offers an early opportunity to make a statement. <br>Kickoff is scheduled for this weekend.<br> (Image By:📷 Ezivuthayo Emaputaland/ Facebook)

    <h2>Yusuf Maart Completes European Move from Kaizer Chiefs to SV Ried</h2>
    <h6 class="dateandauthor">By Azola Ngxanga | 15 July 2025</span></h6>

    <p>
      Yusuf Maart has officially completed a transfer from Kaizer Chiefs to Austrian Bundesliga club SV Ried, marking a significant step in the midfielder’s career as he moves abroad for the first time at the age of 29.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The deal was confirmed earlier this week after weeks of speculation, with the South African international set to join Ried ahead of the 2025–26 Austrian season.

The move brings an end to Maart’s three-year spell at Kaizer Chiefs, where he served as club captain and became a fan favourite through his leadership and consistent performances in midfield. Chiefs reportedly exercised a one-year extension clause in his contract in June but ultimately agreed to release him for a transfer fee of approximately €1 million. While Transfermarkt also lists Maart’s market value at €1 million, multiple reports confirm that SV Ried reached an agreement to secure the player on a permanent deal.<br><br>
Maart made 95 appearances in all competitions for Amakhosi, scoring seven goals and assisting eight. His most iconic moment came in May 2025 when he scored the winning goal in the Nedbank Cup final, ending the club’s ten-year trophy drought. His farewell message to the club and supporters was emotional, as he thanked teammates, coaches, and fans for standing by him through highs and lows. He described Kaizer Chiefs as a place that will “always be home.”<br><br>
Now entering a new phase of his career, Maart arrives at SV Ried as the club prepares for its return to the Austrian top flight. In his unveiling, the midfielder said he was excited by the challenge of playing in Europe and grateful for the opportunity. He acknowledged the physical nature of Austrian football and committed to adapting quickly to make a strong impact. SV Ried’s management praised Maart’s technical ability, international experience, and leadership qualities.<br><br>
Kaizer Chiefs, meanwhile, have already named Angolan international Miguel Inacio as the club’s new captain. The club is expected to reinforce its midfield during the transfer window as it prepares for both domestic competition and its upcoming CAF Confederation Cup campaign.<br><br>

      Banyana Banyana are back in action tonight as they face Tanzania in a pivotal Group C match at the 2025 CAF Women's Africa Cup of Nations in Oujda, Morocco.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The match kicks off at 21:00 South African time at the Honneur Stadium, with South Africa looking to make it two wins from two and edge closer to a place in the quarterfinals.<br><br>
        Linda Motlhalo scored from the penalty spot and Jermaine Seoposenwe added a second in South Africa's opening 2–0 win over Ghana. Speaking ahead of the Tanzania clash, coach Desiree Ellis said: "Yes, we have played Tanzania before, but that goes out of the window — it means nothing. We must make sure we don't concede. We are going to create opportunities, and we need to take those opportunities and be more effective in the attacking third."<br><br>
        Tanzania are coming off a narrow defeat to Mali and are under pressure to get a result. South Africa, meanwhile, know a second win would put them in control of the group with one game remaining.

      Banyana Banyana kicked off their Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) title defense with an impressive 2-0 win over Ghana this evening at the Honneur Stadium in Oujda.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        The reigning champions showed poise and tactical discipline to secure three crucial points in their opening Group C clash.

        The match started under the scorching Moroccan sun, but South Africa quickly settled into their rhythm. In the 27th minute, midfielder Noxolo Cesane was brought down inside the box by Ghana's Grace Asantewaa. After a brief VAR check, the referee pointed to the spot. Linda Motlhalo confidently stepped up and slotted the penalty low into the right corner, sending the South African fans into jubilation.<br><br>
        Just six minutes later, Banyana Banyana doubled their lead. Lebohang Ramalepe's pinpoint through ball found Jermaine Seoposenwe, who calmly finished past Ghana goalkeeper Cynthia Konlan, leaving the Black Queens stunned.<br><br>
        Ghana responded in the second half, pressing hard and hitting the woodwork twice, but they could not break down a resilient Banyana defense marshaled by veteran Bambanani Mbane. Mbane's leadership was crucial in maintaining a clean sheet, earning her the Player of the Match honor.<br><br>
        Head coach Desiree Ellis praised her side's performance, especially their defensive discipline. "We knew keeping a clean sheet was key tonight, and the girls showed great composure in tough conditions," Ellis said post-match. "The heat was intense, but the team managed it well." <br><br>
        With this win, Banyana Banyana top Group C and will look to build on this momentum when they face Tanzania in their next match on Friday.<br> (Image By: 📷Banyana Banyana/X)

      Cape Town – Once seen as a rising force in South African football, Cape Town City's journey in the Premiership has come to a painful halt.
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        After a rollercoaster season filled with promise and setbacks, the Citizens' hopes were dashed by a narrow 1–0 loss to Orbit College in the promotion/relegation playoffs.The defeat not only ended City's fight to stay in the top flight but also crowned Orbit College with a historic promotion to the Premiership for the first time.<br><br>
         A season marked by coaching upheavals, key departures, and a damaging winless streak left City struggling to find form. Despite a late charge under the experienced Dutch coach Andries Ulderink, the comeback proved just out of reach. Supporters are left stunned, as their team now faces the tough task of regrouping and climbing back from the Motsepe Foundation Championship next season.<br><br>

      SuperSport United has been sold to Siwelele Football Club (Pty) Ltd in a deal valued at around R50 million, pending approval from the Premier Soccer League (PSL).
      <span class="more-text" style="display:none;">
        This marks the end of an era for the club, which has been a PSL mainstay since its founding in 1994.

        The sale comes as SuperSport International shifts its focus back to its core broadcasting business. CEO Rendani Ramovha explained that this move allows the company to remain Africa's biggest broadcaster.<br><br>
        Siwelele FC, led by chairman Calvin Le John, plans to relocate the team to Bloemfontein and rebrand the club, adopting the green-and-white colors once associated with Bloemfontein Celtic. However, due to naming rights, the club will compete as Siwelele FC.<br><br>
        While this transition opens new opportunities, fans and analysts express concerns about preserving the club's identity and community ties amid growing private ownership in South African football.<br><br>
        If approved, Siwelele FC will enter the 2025–26 PSL season under new ownership, marking a fresh start for the historic club.<br> (Image By: 📷SupersportBets)
