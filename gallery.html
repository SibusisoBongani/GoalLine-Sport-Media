South Africa kept pace, and Tristan Stubbs hit a last-ball six to level it again — sending the match into a historic second Super Over.<br><br><b>Super Over 2: Drama Decides the Winner</b><br><br>In the deciding mini-match, South Africa set a challenging 23 runs, with Stubbs and David Miller delivering big hits. Afghanistan\'s chase started brightly, with Gurbaz smashing three consecutive sixes, but the Proteas held firm.
