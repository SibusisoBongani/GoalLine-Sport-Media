The sky was a swirl of cotton candy pink and lavender when the tiny dragon with polka-dotted wings landed on my windowsill. It sneezed, and a shower of glitter erupted into the air, coating my textbooks in sparkles. "You’re late," I muttered, though I had no idea what I was expecting. The dragon—whose name, I later learned, was Sir Muffins the Third—gestured wildly toward the horizon, where a floating island hovered above the clouds. With a sigh, I grabbed my backpack and a half-eaten granola bar before climbing onto its back. The wind roared in my ears as we shot into the sky, passing by startled birds and a very confused weather balloon. Below us, the city shrank into a grid of glowing lights, and ahead, the island grew larger, revealing a forest of upside-down trees with glowing blue leaves. Sir Muffins chirped excitedly as we landed, and that’s when I saw them—the marshmallow-shaped creatures hopping around a campfire, roasting what looked like miniature pizzas. One of them waved at me with a stick and offered a slice, and I realized, with a start, that this was the most bizarre Tuesday I’d ever had.
